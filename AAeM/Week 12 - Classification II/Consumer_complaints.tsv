2016-11-18	Mortgage	Conventional fixed mortgage	Settlement process and costs		Started the refinance of home mortgage process with cash out option on XX/XX/2016. Necessary documents were submitted by XXXX. After initial review, got good faith estimate with loan amount and closing cost. Based on this estimate, a deposit of {$350.00} was made towards appraisal. Appraisal came with lesser amount by {$5000.00}. Agreed to reduce the loan amount to that extent. However, got a revised estimate which was less by {$30000.00} and with additional closing cost towards points etc. In between got numerous revised estimates with different loan amounts and closing cost. It took more than 2 months to reach any definite closing document. Hence, want to get back the deposit of {$350.00}.

2017-03-04	Bank account or service	Checking account	Account opening, closing, or management		"My wife and I visited the Chase Bank branch at XXXX, XXXX, KY on XX/XX/2017 around XXXX AM to open new checking accounts. We were prompted to open these checking accounts because Chase mailed and emailed us vouchers to receive {$300.00} for opening each account and personal friends had also referred us. XXXX was assigned to assist us in this matter. His first question to us was "" where do you work? "". After informing him that we are both were XXXX employees he asked us what we were going to do with our XXXX accounts. We advised him we would be keeping those accounts open. He then asked what we would be using our new Chase accounts for and I advised we would be using those accounts for miscellaneous savings, etc. It was then that XXXX XXXX advised he would not be opening the new accounts for us unless we closed our XXXX accounts and he tossed the Chase Voucher and our ID 's back across the desk to us ( RUDE! ). Confused, I questioned him further about this and he advised that he did not believe we were going to use our new Chase accounts and would just close them in 6 months. Upon clarifying that we would indeed keep the Chase accounts open and meet all of the requirements of the offer he stated that we would not be closing our XXXX accounts. He reiterated that he would not open the accounts for us and advised that he would get his manager XXXX involved. When XXXX XXXX arrived in the office to speak with us she advised that Chase would not be honoring the vouchers and would not open accounts for us because XXXX XXXX told her we were not planning to keep the accounts open and would not be "" using '' the accounts. I advised XXXX XXXX that we intended to meet the minimum requirements ( set up direct deposit and keep the account open for 6 months ) and would keep the accounts open further if we enjoyed the service we received from Chase during that time. I advised we intended to have direct deposit active on the accounts and would be moving money in and out of the accounts, but she did not seem to believe that was qualifying usage of the accounts. She then advised that I had previously opened a Chase account with a coupon about 10 years ago and did not keep it open. However, I believe that account was my primary checking account and I did keep it open for the required period of time and more. It was only when I moved out of state that I closed the account because I did not know if there would be Chase branches in my new area. I am deeply insulted by my experience in trying to open these new accounts and feel that my wife and I have been discriminated against because of our employment with another banking institute. In addition to this occurrence while my wife and I we waiting in the lobby to meet with XXXX XXXX we both were able to clearly observe XXXX 's business interactions with another customer who was in his cubicle/office which has an open door and clear glass windows. We were able to hear their entire conversation and at a certain point XXXX XXXX pulled that customer 's XXXX score. After pulling the XXXX score up on his monitor he swiveled the monitor around so that it was facing directly out the window into the lobby and I could clearly see the customer 's score was XXXX. Being in the banking business I understand well that this is a clear violation of Customer Confidentiality regulations and should be dealt with as such."		JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

2017-04-12	Bank account or service	Checking account	Problems caused by my funds being low		"I have documentation that shows that US Bank would not charge a Returned Item Fee nor an Overdraft Fee on my account ( Number XXXX ). When a withdrawal or other debit came in and there were non-sufficient funds, the payment was returned, without charging any fees, unless the resulting overdraft amount was negligible ( This occurred seven times between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX on the old account as shown by notices received in the mail attached herein ). 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a new account at US Bank ( XXXX XXXX ). On XX/XX/XXXX, an overdraft fee was charged, and a few days later two other payments were returned, one other was returned and more fees were added. The Bank has failed to provide satisfactorily explanation of this change in policy. At the time of opening the new account, I was not given any notice or warning that new rules would apply. The Bank keeps adding extended overdraft fees. 
In my perception, the bank should have not honored any payments that were underfunded nor charged any fees for overdraft nor returned items because US Bank created a reasonable expectation through consistent behavior upon which reliance was reasonable. The Bank should bring the account to XXXX balance at its own expense. Further, the bank should refrain form a threatened charge off or any other report that will harm my credit history."

2017-03-04	Credit card		Balance transfer		Around XX/XX/XXXX I accepted a credit card offer from my Chase AARP card at a 0 % interest for a year with a 2 % transfer fee. Needing the money, I called Chase and asked them to deposit XXXX into my checking account and, shortly there after, they did so. Now, they are wanting the XXXX. back from my checking account. They say it was their error but they should n't have deposited the money because that checking account has n't been used to pay a Chase fee within 3 months, so could n't be approved for the transfer.. I had XXXX balances so there was no need to make a payment. They made this decision after they deposited the money into my account.They say they will pay the bank fees but where am I supposed to get the XXXX?. I do not have all of the XXXX left and what is there is allocated for checks and payments that have not cleared yet. I accepted their offer and borrowed this money in good faith and have spent many hours on the phone with various Chase reps and am that the account is active, has XXXX available credit, but they can not assign the money already borrowed to that account because it was n't used for 3 months. Surely they can lift the rule to cover their error, but they wo n't. The woman, who said she was a manager, gave me the fax number of Chase Executive Offices as my only recourse. So, I am contacting you. This is an AARP card, available only to XXXX. They are causing havoc in my life and do not care at all. Please help		JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

2017-03-06	Credit reporting		Incorrect information on credit report	Account status	XXXX has wrongfully placed an account in collections. XXXX has indicated that I owed {$1700.00} for water bills at XXXX. This is absolutely false. All of the bills were in good standing upon leaving. This company bulldogged and bullied me into leaving the property. They initiated an eviction on me when all of the rents were paid on time. Elite home management has placed this account in collection with National Credit Systems. I would like this account removed from collections immediately. Attached is full documentation that this account was paid in full. Additionally, XXXX kept my deposit. I would like to request my deposit be returned as I left the property in good standing and was NEVER late paying monthly rent. Please see all attached documentation. Furthermore, the claim that XXXX is stating I owe monies for a water bill is false. The amount started in XXXX of 2012. The account was never placed in my name and started with a balance of over {$700.00}! XXXX presented false documents to the court in order to have me evicted from the property. I 'm requesting that this is immediately removed from my credit report and handled outside of a credit reporting agency as these claims are false!

After one year making payments requested a buy-out amount and the information received for the buy-out total {$63000.00}. I called Ally auto asking why is the buy-out same the original purchase price? There answer was the payment paid does not deduct from the lease amount. This was surprise to me and the lease residual is at 49 % of the purchase price which the lease payment considered as a rent payment. I 've had leases with other banks and never experienced this before which each payment you make it does deduct from the purchase price. Ally is refusing to correct based on the guidelines and lease practices. I am not able to exchange the car for a better lease terms and by trading the car for another lease loan I will be in upside down situation. Could you please help with this matter?

2017-03-04	Debt collection	Credit card	Communication tactics	Called after sent written cease of comm	Dear XXXX Staff, XXXX bankruptcy filed in XX/XX/XXXX. Bankruptcy was dismissed in about XX/XX/XXXX due to falling behind on plan payments. My husband is XXXX became permanently XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. I am XXXX, permanently laid off from my job of eight years and have filed for XXXX. Pennsylvania statue of limitations to collect a debt is four years. Portfolio Recovery Associates started contacting us by phone and US mail sometime after the bankruptcy was dismissed. I told them our situation and the statute of limitations in Pennsylvania verbally and also have sent them a letter to cease and desist. They continued to call us and send us bill statements in the mail. We registered our telephone numbers with the Do Not Call List several years ago. Their behavior is considered harassment to us. Just recently, they also placed a collection derogatory remark on both of our credit reports without notifying us of such action. They were asked to remove the derogatory remarks from our credit reports, but they have not complied with the request. They have been asked verbally and in written communication not to contact us and that we are on the XXXX Not Call List. Portfolio Recovery Associates is a debt buyer of old debt for pennies on the dollar and then attempt to collect the full amount plus fees for debts that are past the statue of limitations for collecting. Please try to stop them from harassing us anymore and please try to get them to remove the derogatory collection comment from both our credit reports. Thank You.

2017-03-04	Money transfers	International money transfer	Other service issues		Moneygram is applying arbitrary rules to block legitimate transactions, collecting unnecessary personal data, and upon receipt of this information from me they are choosing not to offer the service they falsely advertised, under false pretense, with no recourse whatsoever to the consumer whose very personal information they now possess. I verified this by attempting to send a {$15000.00} XXXX dollar transaction to my friend in XXXX, which is around {$120.00} XXXX dollars. I was required to answer questions about the nature of our relationship, when I last saw her, where we met, how often I see her, and then was asked for the birthdates of several family members and a close friend and business associate. I provided this information truthfully, and patiently, during a XXXX minute call where all my information was given to an offshore call center agent. The end result was to be told that they would not send my transaction due to a decision by Moneygram Security, which is an algorithm, or amorphous intelligence appartus of a private or public-private nature, or some kind of unaccountable agency or group within the company, or perhaps merely a machine learning model. Bottom line, there was no rhyme or reason to the decision, and the company did not feel compelled to justify their actions in any manner. I recognize that most customers of these money transfer services are immigrants, and public policy currently opposes immigrants, but I am a native-born United States of America citizen who was trying to use this service to send slightly more than a XXXX dollars to a friend. If a money transfer business will not provide this service to Americans, it should not be allowed to do business in this country.

2017-03-04	Bank account or service	Other bank product/service	Account opening, closing, or management		I contacted a representative of Key Bank about a mortgage. The very first thing I told her was that I had a lot of student loan debt and asked if the program would work for me. She said yes. I then told her that I had already had my credit run a few times and we needed to wait for my report to show the correct payments on my student loans. She said I can check XXXX and monitor it for the correct payments, then let her know so she could run my credit. I did this, then emailed her that XXXX did not show the correct payments yet and we should wait. She then said that she had already run my credit report. Not only did I not authorize this, but I explicitly stated I did not want to run it yet. Because of this, I have too many inquiries on my record and my score has dropped XXXX points in at least XXXX of the agencies. This is a measurable difference of over $ 100/month on my mortgage payment, a serious financial damage. This inquiry must be removed from my record.

This is the explicit reason I applied for this card this past XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/2016 Barclays decided to change to terms and conditions they offered to new Military members. They stated they were trying to bring them selves in line with everyone else in terms of SCRA. Every card service representative I talked to stated that if you were a previous card holder this would not affect you. Only new account holders after XX/XX/2016. After 10 month of having this card I received a notice in the mail stating that they could no longer honor the original terms and would begin accessing my account the annual fee of {$990.00}. I understand that Barclays Bank went well beyond any other creditor in regards to SCRA. However, not honoring the original terms of agreement to current card members is just bad business.

I had and have multiple reduce of incomes over the last two years. 
Previous modification in XXXX was not reduced enough to support my income. My 3.75 % interest remain the same, although rates were down considerably during XX/XX/XXXX. 
I am asking for an investigation of the last mitigation from my loan company whether I was within the 31 % of my income bracket. 
What about being able to get a Tier 2 in house modification? 
I had several hardships in the last two years, but I feel they are overlooked and have not been considered viable to getting a loan modification. 
I am requesting a copy of my loan company DEED, to see if my title was accepted and delivered to my loan company from my original mortgage company, to show if my current loan company has legally obtained my deed. 
I am requesting an investigation into whether my equity in my home has been used by my current loan company during my several requests for trying to negotiate ways to keep my home ... however, my equity has not been used to pay off my {$25.00}, 000 loan deficits. Why??????? 
Whether my income was low or high, the I never was within the 31 % bracket to obtain a new modification, Why???? 
Who are my loan company lawyers that are calling asking for personal information, but do not say who they are and who they represent? Who are the lawyers putting foreclosure information on my door, but do not say who they represent? Are they my loan company lawyers? 
I am investigating whether my loan company is legally my loan company that I been paying since XXXX? Was my deed and title transferred through acceptance and delivery? Or was this another "" robo copy '' transfer?

Ocwen Loan Servicing / XXXX / American Home Mortgage / Homeward Residential all have slandered my title using fraud. XXXX, I retained another incompetent lawyer who filed lawsuit against Ocwen Loan Servicing. Ocwen Loan Servicing scums offered me a {$660000.00} loan modification in agreement I dismiss the pending action and keep Ocwen 's fraud cover-ups a big hush hush. At that time the trustee sale was already cancelled so I did n't submit and bend over to scum Ocwen demands, I declined the offer. I do n't owe XXXX Ocwen a single penny. XXXX I retained another incompetent lawyer who filed another lawsuit, during pending litigation Ocwen attempted to push through another XXXX fraudulent trustee sale. My incompetent lawyer appeared before the court to stop Ocwen Loan Servicing fraudulent foreclosure and its cozy buddy XXXX fraudulent trustee sale. My motion was denied because my incompetent lawyer did n't follow the rules of the court and did n't serve all the defendants properly. I fired my lawyer, then I was in pro-per repersenting myself with little money left. Ocwen Loan Servicing used my health troubles and having little money left as another weapon to take advantage of me. During the time I was representing myself in pro-per Ocwen Loan Servicing, its cozy buddy Altisource, and its XXXX lawyer "" XXXX '' all took advantage of my XXXX and then increased the fraudulent loan modification offer to {$750000.00} with a higher interest rate, then made threats that if I did n't sign the final none negotiable {$750000.00} loan modification offer Ocwen Loan Servicing would instruct its buddy XXXX to proceed with the fraudulent trustee sale and I would of lost my home I own free and clear for years. I have XXXX so hard for me to fight a bunch of XXXX.

2017-04-04	Bank account or service	Checking account	Account opening, closing, or management		"This is a complaint against First Hawaiian Bank for its grossly incompetent management of its supposedly new and improved website. I 've been a customer since approximately 2003, and I have never had problems with my account as bad as I have in the last few months with the roll-out of the new site. 

Tonight, I spent one hour trying very hard to access my account online and then trying to transfer funds. Along the way, I made two phone calls to FHB Online where I spoke with a total of four representatives. Not one of them had even the slightest clue of how badly the site was performing. Specifically, every time I tried to perform ANY operation, the site automatically displayed an error message. When I tried to make an external transfer FHB Online stopped the attempted transaction and said it would send a code to my phone for verification. But FHB never called my phone -- even after an hour. The broken system did nearly the same thing when I tried to ( re ) add my XXXX account as an external account. FHB displayed a message that my XXXX account credentials were invalid. ( Yet these were the same credentials that I have been using on my XXXX account for years. So there was nothing wrong with my XXXX online ID, password, or pin. ) But far and away, the very worst issue was my truly sad experience with "" XXXX '' in the Online Banking Department. ( She said it was bank policy to refuse to provide her last name or even an employee number. ) Despite the incredible amount of time XXXX and I spent on the phone with her asking me the same questions over-and-over again, she could not understand that the FHB site was not performing as she expected it to. For example, she insisted there would be a blue arrow in front of my name. After asking me about this three times, I refused to answer the same question anymore. I had enough with the FHB site and its employees who were deeply in the dark about the site 's issues. 

There is obviously something seriously wrong with the FHB website. It is not performing adequately. While I was on the phone with FHB, I had absolutely no problem accessing my XXXX and XXXX accounts. So the issue is not my connection -- and hopefully not even my XXXX browser. Clearly my access to funds through the site is blocked. But I am far more concerned with FHB 's employees ' inability to troubleshoot, assist, or even acknowledge something is wrong."

2017-03-04	Student loan	Federal student loan servicing	Dealing with my lender or servicer	Trouble with how payments are handled	"In XX/XX/XXXX NAVIENT notified me by letter that they were increasing my monthly payment of {$180.00} by {$71.00} - to be effective with my XX/XX/XXXX payment. No explanation for the change to my repayment plan was provided in the letter. I have made all the monthly payments on time since XX/XX/XXXX and have never been notified by NAVIENT that I was delinquent on any monthly payment prior to XX/XX/XXXX or that I owed any late fees. I called the company for an explanation and a written accounting of why they are attempting to collect an amount in excess of the original repayment amount listed in the promissory note, but they offered no further details about why the change was being sought. Therefore, I continue to pay the original amount ( {$180.00} ) and have not paid the increased amount. However, since then I continue to receive letters and calls from NAVIENT informing me that I am now delinquent on my loan. 

The terms of the loan are clearly listed in the original promissory note which I attached with my submission : {$15000.00} borrowed at 8.5 % interest to be repaid over 10 yrs ; 120 payments at {$180.00} with the first payment due in XX/XX/XXXX and the final payment due in XX/XX/XXXX ). The increased payment of {$260.00} demanded by NAVIENT is effectively a change in the original loan terms as documented in the promissory note and amounts to an overcharge of {$1000.00} on the loan."

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX of the church went to the Wells Fargo Bank ( XXXX, MD XXXX ). They spoke with Personal Banker NMLSR ID : XXXX. XXXX. The XXXX presented the certified copy with raised seal of our Articles of Inc., tax ID letter, church check books, bank statements, and their driver and non-driver ID ( matching the signatures on the church articles of incorporation. Personal Banker NMLSR ID : XXXX was informed that on XX/XX/XXXX two men were not members of XXXX. had been allowed to put their name on our church bank accounts at the XXXX MD XXXX. Counter checks were created for their use. A check was written on XX/XX/XXXX to one of these men in the amount of {$900.00}. It is our understanding that they met with Personal Banker NMLSR : XXXX located at XXXX MD. XXXX. Banker NMLSR ID : XXXX contacted the Wells Fargo Bank legal department. The legal department stated that they would correct this matter after the articles of incorporation where taken to the Maryland State Department to be updated. The articles of incorporation were updated and returned to Banker NMLSR ID : XXXX approximately XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX NMLSR ID : XXXX sent a copy of the certified articles of Inc.. to the legal department. The control and proper names were applied to the account. After the banks error we requested to have a new bank account. Sadly Wells Fargo allowed the processing of a second counter check signed by one of the men who was not a member of our church in the amount of {$600.00} written on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX we spoke with the Service Manager ( XXXX MD XXXX ) due to are bank cards not working properly. When we discovered that the reason for the trouble was that the Personal Banker NMLSR : XXXX located at XX/XX/XXXX MD. XXXX had removed our names from the account and replaced them again with these same men and added a woman who was also not a member of our church. 
The actions of Wells Fargo Bank allowing these people without proper documentation to be assigned to our account as signers. This has caused tremendous stress and hardship upon the church as a whole.

2017-03-04	Credit card		Delinquent account		"Capital One reported my auto loan payments late several consecutive times. I have several credit cards with Capital One and all paid on time. Never late. I closed them because I noticed a pattern of discrimination. The higher my credit score went the more interest I paid. With my car loan, in XXXX, I was overpaying Capital One and caught them lying about what I owed. They repaired the issue. In the fall of XXXX they started overcharging me again, so I demanded they show proof. While I waited, they never disclosed their malfeasant actions toward me, they continued to mark me late. I researched all my credit reports and noticed they are all over the place, so I contacted all the XXXX and they informed me, they report only report what Capital One tells them, so why are the payments in different years and months??? Both Capital One and the Credit Bureaus, specifically XXXX stated it is ok and legal for them to be different because it happens all the time. I vehemently disagree for the following reason. 
Credit scores permeate our entire lives, and the Credit Bureaus must be accurate because credit scores impact our QUALITY OF LIFE and PROSPERITY. 
XXXXXXXX We need a good credit score to buy a home 2. A good score is needed to buy a car 3. Health Insurance premiums hinge on our credit score, not logical - it is criminal 4. Car Insurance uses our credit to offer us car insurance - it does not hinge on your driving record anymore, it depends on your credit score which is criminal. 
5. To rent an apartment - your credit score is used. 
6. Physicians are asking for credit report to obtain medical care - their reason - Dentist say, if you need major dental work, we must ensure your good for it. 
Credit Scores permeate our lives, so for Capital One, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX to have such a casual attitude is dangerous. Our Federal Government must insert FINES and new REGULATIONS for Companies and Credit Reporting Agencies to ensure they are taking consumers credit reporting seriously. 
Please ask Capital One to remove the XXXX and XXXX of XXXX late payments off my credit reports. Thank you."		CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION	CT	060XX		Consent provided	Web	2017-03-04	Closed with explanation	True	No	2371615

Being compensated by 100 % commission, we have had months where the money was not there to make the required payments. Therefore, we have been placed on forbearance numerous times. This has caused the student loans to accumulate to the point of no return. Right now the monthly payment is {$4900.00}.

Subsequently our account was locked for suspected fraud. We called Capital one verified our identity and the changes. Capital One requested supporting documentation from us consisting of drivers license copies, utility bills, and a copy of our Social Security card for each cardholder. We thought this an odd request especially since we have been using the card for over a year. We advised them that we were fine sending in everything with the exception of our Social Security card copies as we were not comfortable for security reasons with them having or storing a digital copy of our social security cards. We then sent in drivers license and utility bills for each card holder and with held the Social Security cards. For some reason After numerous calls Capital One refuses to remove the fraud hold on our card until we provide digital copies of our social security cards, which we will not do. This caused disruptions in our business so we opened another card with another company. 

We called Capital One to close our account due to the fact that we were at an impasse. At the time we had a balance of approximately {$560.00}. We had accrued {$510.00} in cash rewards using the card for the last year. We requested to use the cash rewards we had earned to close out the account and fund the balance. Capital One now refuses to let us use our cash rewards until we send in our social security cards. We paid the balance and it seems we will now loose our cash rewards because we refuse to let Capital One have a copy of our Social Security cards.

2017-03-04	Student loan	Federal student loan servicing	Dealing with my lender or servicer	Trouble with how payments are handled	"In 2001, I enrolled in XXXX in XXXX, Colorado ( later moved to XXXX, Colorado ) for the XXXX program with XXXX servicing my loan. As you may or may not be aware, XXXX is now closed due to an investigation into fraudulent practices. When it came time to repay my loan with XXXX, I did so as directed. In doing so, I noticed many times that no matter when I made the payment, the next statement would show up showing I owed late fees. I attempted to pay early so that I would n't accrue late fees and still they would show up on the following months statement. Phone calls to XXXX were not helpful, if responsive at all. 
Later, the national recession hit and I got well behind on my loan. So much so that I had a garnishment put on my wages. XXXX, through Pioneer Credit Recovery, started me on what they called a rehabilitation program in order to bring my loans current. I finished the program and believed that my loan was current and that, as ( now ) Navient explained in their correspondence, all negative effects would be removed from my credit. However, apparently the rehabilitation program only affected my Federal loans and did not rehabilitate the past due private loans. These private loans still show as delinquent on my credit report. Navient made no attempt to inform me that the rehabilitation would n't repair my entire account. 
Each month, I pay {$150.00} through automatic payment to Navient. Yet with them still showing that loans are delinquent, my balance never goes down and my credit is in major disrepair."		Navient Solutions, LLC.	CO	802XX		Consent provided	Web	2017-03-04	Closed with explanation	True	Yes	2371880

The credit card company told me i had 560 days for a max extension to dispute from the date of transaction which would extend me to XX/XX/XXXX. The contractor had not installed the garage floor till XX/XX/XXXX due to his backlog. When garage floor was installed the credit card was already cancelled since i had paid the balance off. I anticipated issues due to history of contractors and ended up being correct. There was faulty workmanship discovered. I contacted Chase Ink to dispute and they "" purged '' my account just a few months later after it was closed. Sent a fax to the correspondence team ( only fax provided ) with no response yet my fax went via ( proof of sent/received time stamp ) .The customer service dept states once the account is purged there is nothing they can do about it. I have the right as a consumer to dispute and this purge now violates my rights for consumer protection. I have also sent a request to the Chase XXXX office. I told them they have the legal obligation to hold records for a certain period of time. I can understand if something was purged after a few years but a few months later?

Bank of America set-up installment payments to be automatically withdrawn from my account. The installments were incorrectly set-up by the bank, and I therefore defaulted on the agreement. I paid {$1400.00} of the {$1700.00} settlement. The remaining balance on the credit card then went into collections, was charged off, and was then sold to a collection agency. I did my best to pay the full amount of the settlement only to later learn it was not satisfied due to what is clearly bank error. Not only do I still owe on this account according to the bank and the new owner of the debt, but my credit is even further damaged.

'' So what I did to get him off the phone is to tell him to email me the paper work for what I owe and told him I would pay it, but I was n't. I then contacted Advance America about my account and found out I only owed {$110.00}. I gave them the company name that was trying to get all this money out of me and they had never heard of them. Advance America gave me the number to the people that they said they sold my acct. to. They told me they sold my account on XXXX XXXX, 2017. They gave me the number to the company they sold it to and it was not XXXX, so I thought. Once I called XXXX different numbers it led my back to XXXX under a different name. They were operating under XXXX different names, as a Legal company. When the answering machine picked up to my surprise it was XXXX, the company Advance America said they knew nothing about. At this point XXXX called me back on XXXX/XXXX/2017 and told them I found out my balance from Advance America, so he made another offer of {$200.00}. I told him no, I was not paying what I did n't owe. I did tell him I would pay the {$110.00} if they sent me another settlement letter. They never sent another XXXX. Today is XXXX/XXXX/2017 and they have not called or mailed or emailed anything. These people are scammers and must be closed and stopped. They threaten to garnish my pay check, without being sued or going to court. Told me I would be criminally charged. These messages were left on my mother phone by a person named XXXX XXXX and she also called my uncle and sister telling him the same things. XXXX XXXX made the same threats. These people called everyone in your family that they can contact. This is a tacked used to embarrass you, so their intended victim calls them and they can scare you into paying them extortion money. They work in teams, XXXX pretending to be the server, and the other pretending to be the verification person and another person pretending to be the Attorney name they use when they talk to you and send out settlement letters, which is XXXX XXXX Attorney at Law. Please stop these people and the Attorney that 's involved in this madness. By the way XXXX has a F rating with the BBB and the Attorney has aN A rating. Go figure. They also send this to read as your rights for them getting money out of you. XXXX. Instead of the FEDERAL LAW ( FDCPA ) REQUIREMENTS."

2017-03-27	Credit reporting		Incorrect information on credit report	Account status	I have been disputing this information for the past two years and it keeps getting worse. My child was in the band when she was in middle school. I rented an instrument from XXXX back then and turned it in on time. I no longer have anything with them. I noticed on my report last year that they were saying the account was 30 days late and I disputed it, but nothing was done. I disputed it again and then they started reported it as paid as agreed and that I was paying every month. I do n't have anything from them, nor am I paying on any account. So they have it as a creditor and they also have it in my collection section showing that as a negative remark. They keep reporting this and it is impacting my credit score dramatically. They keep reporting it every single month on moth sides. I have sent a letter to XXXX and to the Credit Bureau and they continue to report it. My credit score dropped down when they added it to my current creditors as if I had credit with them.

I filed a complaint through your firm and Experian responded that they would follow up in 60 days. Experian issued a final report to me several weeks ago but have yet to update their response to your organization. I remain hopeful that filing another complaint will warrant immediate action. There are several XXXX accounts that are reporting on my credit report inaccurately. These accounts list that I filed a bankruptcy in XX/XX/2016 and XX/XX/2016 which false. I must assume that someone has compromised my identity and have opened these accounts without my consent. I have NEVER, EVER filed a bankruptcy in XX/XX/2016 or XX/XX/2016 or at any point in time in XX/XX/2016. Please delete these accounts from my file immediately. I am also requesting that Experian follows up with your organization in a timely manner. This inaccurate reporting is creating a significant financial strain and hardship. I believe that Experian is discriminating against me because of my ethnicity.

2017-03-18	Money transfers	Domestic (US) money transfer	Fraud or scam		Yes, around a year ago possibly 10 months, I had saw a firearm on a website used to trade and sell firearms ( XXXX ). To make a long story short I tried to purchase the gun and sent the guy money via PayPal. You can send money two ways one way ( friends and family ) that way does n't charge the seller any fees as it is mostly used to just send money and PayPal does n't back that. Second ( goods and service ) if you send it this way you will have PayPal protection. Well I sent it via friends and family as the seller had instructed so I could buy the firearm cheaper. Well it turned out the guy was trying to scam me, I tried to contact him for days and he would n't respond. He then sent me a check that had more money than I was owed on it. And wanted the difference so I was trying to be a good guy but ended almost being scammed again. I payed using my XXXX card and almost lost that money but XXXX actually fought for me. But I am still actually missing the original XXXX dollars I had sent. I tried for months but XXXX would not fight for me to get my money from PayPal.

2017-04-14	Credit reporting		Incorrect information on credit report	Public record	I was not approved for a transaction I was purchasing with my credit card one day last summer, and when I called the bank they stated the account was on hold for a bankruptcy. I then went to get my credit report from online and saw a bankruptcy and judgement that I have no knowledge of whatsoever. I then went to file a police report, I sent documents including my FTC affidavits and dispute letters which I sent to the alleged creditors and it appears they are in some kind of ponzi scheme or false deception against the people to not disclose valid information or not investigate validate any proof verified and signed by a witness of a notary. The reporting agencies are not following lawful procedure. The information being reported is not accurate information. I have been a victim of fraud and contacted the FTC all these illegal actions are hurting me and my family. I have never filed for any bankruptcy at any time and do not know how all these accounts are being opened in my name fraudulently. This item did not occur as presented. Please contact the government agency that is reporting it to verify the detatils, if you do not remove it from my records provide me with written proof of every detail shown in your entry. This is some information I have requested from this credit reporting agency, and I 've yet to received any correspondence about the fraud to be removed.

2017-03-05	Student loan	Non-federal student loan	Dealing with my lender or servicer	Trouble with how payments are handled	I attended the XXXX which is located in XXXX, PA in XXXX of XXXX. I attended a class for XXXX months and finished in XXXX of XXXX. Which I believe this vocational/technical school no longer exists. Anyhow I had taken out a student loan with XXXX which is now navient. At first I was making payments towards my loan efficiently via mail and electronic on their website. But something did seem off now that this lawsuit against them has been filed. Thinking back while making my payments, every time I have received a bill, the amount seemed like I owed more, and the payments I was making did n't seem like they were taking effect with the balance of my amount due. At a point with making payments I declared a forebenece. In which I couldnt make payments because I was not working at the time and it was granted for 3 months. After 3 months I still was n't in the working field so they granted me with another 3 months of forebenece. After 6 months I have n't not received any type of letter or information regarding my loan. Then after a few years when XXXX converted into navient, I then received a letter regarding the conversion of the companies, but no information regarding my student loan and the amount I still owed. Maybe a few months to a year later I still did n't receive anything about my account, I then tried to log into my account online on their website. Since it has been awhile since I logged onto my account at this time I had to reset my password and everything. When I was trying to do so and providing the information that was needed, it kept telling me that there was no record of my information and I had no account. I believe this happened in XXXX I may be wrong. At this point I still havent received any information regarding my account until last year XXXX. I started receiving phone calls at random times of the day which I could n't answer due to being at work and everytime I did try and call back the office was closed. They basically were harassing me via phone but yet did not send anything via mail. Until they did send me a letter in the mail threatening me that they were going to be taking me to court or take a percentage out of my paycheck if I did n't make a payment. Still I had no information of how much I still owed. Then I did contact them via phone I set up a payment plan I started paying however I was not recieving a bill, receipts or anything. All I had was a phone number to make a payment. After a payment of {$260.00} I had made, I sensed that something was n't right so I did n't make another payment. Even with my first payment I have not received a receipt or any bill for my remaining balance. Now that I am working this company had found out what company I am working for and is taking a percentage out of my check that I work very hard for. Still till this day I have not received any type of letter regarding my account balance that 's due. Now just 2 weeks ago I filed my XXXX tax return. Today I just received a letter stating that this company will be interfering with my tax return payment.

They refused to provide me with the paperwork as well as hung up on me. I called back XXXX 4 times after being hung up continuously. After finally speaking with someone and requesting the documents again I was told no multiple times and that I would experience wage garnishments as well as being sued in court if I did not settle the debt immediately. I again asked for the proper documentation that showed I owed the debt the representative refused to send me the paperwork. I asked to speak with their supervisor and was immediately told no that is not possible at this time. I said I will have nothing further to discuss with you until speaking with your supervisor I was hung up on. I 've been called back and got the company name to file the complaint.

2017-03-22	Credit reporting		Incorrect information on credit report	Reinserted previously deleted info	"I just viewed my results from experian and noticed that they re-inserted information that was previously corrected. My XXXX account/XXXX was reporting as accounts that are in good standing. I submitted a letter that I received from XXXX stating that my account was never paid 30 days late back in XX/XX/XXXX and to please correct my credit report. Experian corrected it the first month now I just noticed they put this account as "" accounts that are considered negative '' with a 30 day late payment in XX/XX/XXXX. This is not right. I had to contact XXXX to request this letter from them then send the letter over to experian to have this information corrected and now they are reporting it again in accounts that are potentially negative and should go to a positive status in the year XX/XX/XXXX. I just tried to dispute this information again with experian but the system would not allow me to do so. I am submitting this complaint about experian credit reporting agency because they are affecting my credit score by re-inserting an account into negative when I provided substantial proof to them that this account should be listed under "" ACCOUNTS THAT ARE IN GOOD STANDING ''. I never had a late payment with mandee 's credit card so the information experian is reporting on my credit report is wrong. Again I have to go through the process of submitting this letter to them again wait 30-45 days and hope they correct my credit report. I have spent so much time and effort and letters along with my time in trying to correct the incorrect information that is reporting on my credit file.

2017-03-05	Bank account or service	Checking account	Deposits and withdrawals		"On Tuesday, XXXX XXXX, I applied for a checking and savings accounts online with BBVA Compass Bank. I was accepted and asked to deposit {$25.00} for each account ( {$50.00} total ). The next day, I authorized BBVA Compass bank to withdraw the funds from my account. They withdrew the funds and verified this via email. In addition, I checked my account the verified that the funds had been withdrawn. Once that was completed, I was given the information to set up online. I did that by creating a user name and password. I was told that the funds would not be available for 2- 3 days and I would receive a debit card in 7-14 business days. Again, this communication was via email. I logged into my account via the web on Wednesday and Thursday. On Thursday, XXXX XXXX, I received an email stating that my user access had been disabled. There was no indication on the email as to why it had been disabled. However, the email stated that, "" If you believe this change was made in error, or if you have further questions, please contact ... '' I contacted the number in the email 3 times. The first call was answered but I had been on hold for nearly 10 minutes before a representative answered the line. By that time, I had to go ( I was on a break at work ). I called in the afternoon and waited 30 minutes on hold before hanging up. Finally, later that day, I was able to speak with a representative. Her name was XXXX and I explained to her from the beginning that I did not have the account number. This was because this information was not given in an email ( I understand completely ) and I had not received any written documentation at the time. She said that was fine and she would be able to verify me in other ways. Which she did. Once that was completed, she placed me on hold and said that more documentation was needed. She told me what information was needed and where to email it. During this interaction, I began to feel as if I was getting the run around. The representative told me they had not received payment from me. I explained to her that her company sent emails stating they had received funds. In addition, the funds were taken from my account. I began to feel uneasy and told her I wanted to cancel the accounts and receive a refund. I asked to speak with a supervisor. She placed me on hold and said that a supervisor would call me back in 48 hours. I questioned this because it was Thursday evening. I asked her if they made calls on the weekends and she said they did. On Friday, XXXX XXXX, I emailed the required documentation to BBVA and requested that the accounts be closed and I receive a refund immediately. I later received an email from XXXX XXXX stating that they had received my information and that my information had been forwarded it to 'corporate investigations ' for review but my concerns have not been addressed by this bank ( why the online access was disable and why they show they had received no funds ). In closing, I want to close these accounts and I want my money returned."		BBVA COMPASS FINANCIAL CORPORATION	OK	731XX		Consent provided	Web	2017-03-05	Closed with monetary relief	True	No	2372089

Ocwen did in fact mail us several XXXX photocopies of files that show many other loan numbers attached to our loan still on the house. But, they refuse to show us the transfer history nor the amounts paid by Ocwen to buy this loan. 

Ocwen has stated the loan is paid down to zero, creating a forgiveness of debt issue for us for the {$160000.00} value of this note and mortgage they hold. 

XXXX would like the note and mortgage assigned to him for XXXX dollars since Ocwen claims they have no interest in it any longer. 

Please authorize Ocwen to assign this loan and mortgage to XXXX. 

We also demand a complete history of the escrow account attached to this mortgage with Ocwen. XXXX of dollars was paid into and out of this escrow account and we want a full accounting with the cancelled checks of who got this money.

2017-03-05	Consumer Loan	Vehicle loan	Managing the loan or lease		I had a vehicle loan that was opened by a dealership on my behalf with Chase vehicle loans. I set up my account to automatically pay the bill every month through the Chase website from my Chase checking account. I paid this loan off early, this process closed my chase auto loan account and shut off access to it ( which makes sense you should n't need access to it ). My issue is that the automatic bill pay continued to draw the standard payment from my checking account after the account was closed. When I called Chase they informed me that I had to go into my account to cancel the automatic payments however since the account was closed I obviously could not do so. After an hour or so talking to various help desks they were able to cancel future payments to the closed account however the {$640.00} that they had drawn from my checking account was not returned. The Chase representative said it would take 20 business days to return the funds to my account. As Chase requires that their customers cancel recurring payments on accounts that they can not access and then bars customers access to their own funds, I believe that this would fall under the category of deceptive or unfair behavior.

The correspondence also reports that I need to pay to have it removed from my credit report but what is interesting is that it is not on any of my credit reports which made me even more suspicious of this situation.These people are threatening to sue me and place a judgement on my account and wage garnishment as scare tactics which has to be illegal as I truly believe these to be false claims.If I supposedly owed this from XXXX then why in XXXX would they suddenly attempt to collect a so called debt that they claim I owe?

I called again, went through the same ordeal of explaining the issue and being put on hold waiting for the call to be escalated. After 30 min on hold I was told to send a screenshot of the error ( as if they do n't have access to my account! ) and was told that they can not give me ANY time frame on resolving the issue."

I sent payment on XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( I am dispute in these amount {$340.00}, {$620.00} & {$1600.00} payment to XXXX ). The first shipping bottles was sent on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and I received the XXXX package after 3 long weeks of waiting which I finally received by mail service on XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( if she was sent by XXXX or XXXX I can received package early and less damage because package was lay around and less handle careful .... ), after I opened the package I smelled a scent of liquor which turns out was leaking from the bottle along with a label was stain with damage. At which point I decided to take pictures of it, I sent a notice to her and told her I would like to return it. It is apparent and obvious that the bottle was leaking prior her selling it to me. I tried to communicate with her to return it or credit me for damaged bottle. But she stated and told me old stuff may leak or stain ... that is normal for old stuff ... but I told her ... not for me and I do not buy damage goods. I just want return it! I have done some research to try and return it by XXXX or XXXX to send back to her. But liquid goods that leak are not permitted to send back, if the carrier smell or see something leaking they will destroy on site. It is a waste of my time and money, I received another package on XXXX XXXX, XXXX after 6 weeks and I did not open up because I knew should it be damaged due to the postal service, I would be stuck with yet another leaky bottle ( cheap shipping package lay around so long and not handling careful ... return with receipt from XXXX XXXX XXXX ). 
I was advice from my credit card ( Capital One Master Card ) return Items to the seller ( and I had receipt I was sent back ) I did not get credit back to my credit and I also sent all back up pictures and dowload the document to credit card link on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and fax on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and now my credit charge back to my credit card ... even I was return stuff back to seller & credit card I had insurance to protection to buy I tried to get second pinion/ appraisal for the bottle that was damage but I can not find any companies around in XXXX County , Virginia to do so. I even went as far as to going to pawn shop to ask for a second opinion. Which I had no success for various reasons and them thinking it was some kind of law enforcement operation or sting ( in Virginia only XXXX stores are allowed to sell hard liquor ). I will also be discussing with my credit card company. I can bring the goods to your office to see. ( Capital One headquarters is in XXXX XXXX not too far from my house ). Please let me know of any ideas I can use to pursue to this dispute.

2017-04-03	Mortgage	Conventional fixed mortgage	Application, originator, mortgage broker		About a month ago, My wife and I submitted an offer for a XXXX-family home in XXXX, NY and was accepted by the seller. We contacted Wells Fargo for mortgage rate since they suggested that we could be qualified for their jumbo loan. Their jumbo rate offers competitive rate than other banks. Wells Fargo asked us for our personal information and run our credit for mortgage application pre-approval. Our application did n't run as smooth as we would expect, but the loan officer told us that we were not qualified for Jumbo rate. My wife and I decided to go back to XXXX, our primary bank, for a better rate. XXXX loaner office informed me that Wells Fargo had run XXXX credit check on me ( WITHIN A MONTH ) and it affects my credit score significantly. My middle credit score has dropped from XXXX to XXXX, which brought up the interest rate from 4.375 % to 4.625 %.

I sold that property to move into a XXXX, XXXX in XXXX, IA. I contacted Moving Matters, a moving company that specializes in moving seniors into retirement communities. They pack, help downsize, and their designers set up your apartment in the community. I had a cable box, modem and all the hookups needed for the above service. I assumed it was all packed and taken to the XXXX. I checked with the moving company and they said their records showed all items moved as promised. However they told me I would not have needed a cable box at XXXX as the cable was sourced through XXXX. If a resident had a flat screen no cable box was needed. I know I was using the same modem as I used in XXXX or one very similar. ( Model Name-XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) I lived at XXXX very close to a year and for personal reasons decided not to stay after my grace period of 365 days. In all the time I lived there I was never asked about the cable box or any of the equipment issued to me in XXXX. I still maintained the internet and phone so XXXX had my address and contact information. 

I had lived in XXXX for at least four or five months when I got my first collection letter. This letter was my first knowledge of this debt. 
Date XX/XX/XXXX ; Original Creditor-XXXX ; Account # XXXX I have the Modem ( Model Name-XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) in question and a HDMI cable that is XXXX 's I think. I do n't know what happened to the cable box from XXXX. Common sense tells me it was in my apartment when XXXX set up my XXXX system. I was not missing anything other possessions that I had marked for the moving company. 

I have several problems with this claim. 

1. If it is customary to return these items and the information I received with the present system made it clear that is the case, why was I not asked for the XXXX Cable box, Modem and other hardware when I left XXXX? 

2. What was used to hook up my system in XXXX? I would like to see the records of the installation in XXXX to check the Serial # of the modem used against the serial # of the modem installed in XXXX. 

3. Did the installers see the XXXX cable box when they hooked up XXXX. XXXX has assured me that XXXX does all the installation. 

XXXX only handles the equipment they use to distribute the signal. So their technicians would not been involved in my apartment set up.

2017-03-31	Bank account or service	Other bank product/service	Account opening, closing, or management		"The representatives of XXXX went to Wells Fargo Bank in XXXX, GA, on Wednesday on XX/XX/2017, and submitted documents on a promissory note. All representatives of XXXX sat in an office as we presented documents in order to process said documents. The intent of visit was clearly stated. Calls were made to confirm if the papers submitted were in process there was one document that needed to be changed and we retrieved the needed document. The Personal Banker said that, "" It 's a go '' indicating we were ready to exchange on the promissory note. 
Then representatives of XXXX came in on Friday, XX/XX/2017, He attempted to open a business and savings account, which we did not request and, avoiding the very reason we came into the branch, which was to exchange legal tender ( promissory note ). We explained our intent and he then referred us to another Banking institution of Wells Fargo to speak with someone who dealt with our particular financial needs. We then, met with the Personal Banker 's, referal and then he explained that they do honor promissory notes as legal tender, negotiable instruments. He said we ca n't use our promissory note but Wells Fargo creates their own promissory note. We were then directed to corporate at Wells fargo. Several other calls were made to the corporate offices in California, one in XXXX and the other in XXXX XXXX, in attempts to exercise our rights regarding the promissory note according to the UCC law which is under the Federal Reserves and Maritime Law. [ Admiralty law or maritime law is a distinct body of law that governs maritime questions and offenses. It is a body of both domestic law governing maritime activities, and private international law governing the relationships between private entities that operate vessels on the oceans ]. There were 2 of the 3 callers that were very rude and unprofessional and absolutely hateful and mean, when asked questions regarding their position and if we could speak to someone else in a higher position. We got blown off and talked to as brutes, just overall violated our constitutional and civil rights and turned away without the anticipated services rendered that are due us. The corporate office representatives told us they do n't do promissory notes but two branch manager told us they do them and have done them. We have an actual recording of the conversation with one of the managers telling us that he has done several promissory notes and that Wells Fargo create their own ( PN ) on a certain type of paper. While on the phone with the corporate office representative of Wells Fargo, a call was made to the person we spoke to and we were informed by the corporate office representative, that the manager at the bank said he did n't tell us they do promissory note, it was a misunderstanding."

GLOSSA meaning ; written by supreme court judge XXXX, 3. There are two reference books called similar names ( sound familiar? ) -- - One is the XXXX, a popular style guide used widely by newspapers and other publications to provide uniform guidelines and standards for reporters and other writers ; it is a large reference book similar to a dictionary or thesaurus. The other is The XXXX, with an "" s '' which is a much smaller and more limited publication the size of a larger format paperback book, that deals with the subject of "" styles '' or "" stiles '' ( British ) exclusively. The most recent edition I can find is 1948, though there may be more recent editions. 
Both of these publications adequately explain what the Glossa is, as does Black 's Law Dictionary. The earlier versions of the American Bar Association guides to legal style and usage also plainly state that the use of all capital letters denotes either a corporation or a dead man 's estate. 

also by judge XXXX ; XXXX = a living American endowed with all his natural rights XXXX XXXX a foreign situs trust used in commercial shipping XXXX = a foreign estate trust XXXX XXXX a public transmitting utility company XXXX XXXX a public foundation XXXX XXXX a cooperative XXXX = a boat or ship used in public commerce XXXX = a commonwealth trust XXXX = a slave owned by XXXX XXXX = a foreign pauper forbidden to own land XXXX = a taxpayer XXXX = a soldier XXXX = a slave There are dozens of different potential meanings that can be arbitrarily assigned to anyone 's name and used to "" represent '' radically different entities.

2017-03-31	Mortgage	Other mortgage	Settlement process and costs		"I have been a victim of fraud. Back in XX/XX/XXXX I received a phone call from Wachovia about refinancing my mortgage, it seem like a very good idea, since I was in a pick a payment loan with a negative amortization. We decided to take Wachovia 's offer and refi. They they told me that it would be a better idea to modify my mortgage. I was on the phone for about an hour, providing them with all the necessary information. They told us that it would take 2 to 4 weeks before we would get modified, 3 weeks went by, since I did not hear anything from Wachovia, I decided to call them for an update. finally I spoke to a representative ( XXXX ) and he told me that I was missing some documents. ( bank statements ) I told him that I had faxed over the bank statements 3 weeks ago. 
Neatness to say I faxed over the documents again, by then my mortgage was due, so asked XXXX, do I pay my mortgage or do I wait for you to call me. He said that I was modifying and I did not need to pay the mortgage, it was going to be added on to the new mortgage. but I did need to keep continuing paying my 2nd mortgage. 
By XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter for Wachovia stating that I did not pay my mortgage. And I could be facing foreclosure. I immediately call Wachovia about this letter. The funny thing about Wachovia, I could NEVER get the same person on the phone. Now, they told me that I was missing documents, ( most recent pay-stubs ) now I started to certify all letters to Wachovia and fax them also. 
By XX/XX/XXXX. I received another letter in the mail, this time it said that I was going into foreclosure, by now we had enough of this, so I called Wachovia to tell them that I did not want to participate in there games, and that I needed my original loan! until they said that I own them {$18000.00}. How can I owe you that much in 3 months! When my mortgage was only {$1600.00}. a month. 
By now I was very scared, so Wachovia left me with no choice but to continue with this nightmare Again they asked me for more documents, by now there was no way out for me and my family, Wachovia was running the show and we had no control of our life 's. but we wore still paying our 2nd mortgage. 
I spoke to so many Wachovia representative, ( have a record of ) every month they would ask me for the same things. I have {$470.00} of certified letters. It was always something they need it, but the funny part about it, they would never call me, I would ALWAYS have to call them, and of course, I would never talk to same person! 
This nightmare went on for over a year, by now my credit was ruined, the humiliation from our families and friends was too much to bear, people would knock on our door all day long. Take pictures of our house. so our marriage was also ruined. I suffered XXXX. 

At this time Wells Fargo took over Wachovia, and now I was dealing with Wells Fargo In XX/XX/XXXX I was finally approved. They gave me 40 YEARS ON MY MORTGAGE. I only had 24 yrs left, now I have 40 yrs. THANK YOU Wells Fargo. 

To this day my credit was ruined, and Wells Fargo refuses to work with me on fixing my credit, it took them 13 months to get an answer on a modification that I had no control of."

2017-04-12	Credit card		Credit line increase/decrease		A Bank of America credit analyst agreed to open a new Merril Lynch card with sign up offer of XXXX reward points if I closed and transferred 4 existing accounts with their credit lines to the new card. I agreed to do so and received the new Merril Lynch card in the mail with its credit line of {$20000.00} plus ( from transferring my closed accounts credit lines ). Upon activating I was made aware the new card will not be honored per the original offer by the credit analyst and has in fact been closed. So, in addition to not being able to take advantage of the Merril Lynch offer and card, I also lost all the credit lines with the cards I closed by the credit analyst and to no fault of my own. I spoke with a manager in the credit department to address the issue and was told they would not honor the original offer and expectations that were set with me. I would like this to be done as it was Bank of America 's analyst who made these initial arrangements with me.

Posted on XX/XX/2014 by XXXX The United States CONSCRIPTED -- that is, borrowed -- an interest in everything that we would ever do and create -- a "" usufruct '' relationship where our interest and the ownership of every thing within our estate transferred over to them ; and they never gave their control of our property back to us. They have no lawful right to any of it, and no valid claim to us, our land, our businesses, our children, or any other asset of ours. 

These thieves are pretending that we consented to this circumstance and "" volunteered '' to subject ourselves to the United States jurisdiction "" for the War Effort '' in a war that has been over almost a hundred years. 

The expenses that they are responsible for are the expenses of all the shill legal fiction entities that they have created and run "" in your name '' by abusing the right of usufruct. Those expenses include the expenses and debts of the federal "" State '' foreign situs trust doing business as "" XXXX '' and the XXXX ESTATE trust doing business as "" XXXX '' and the XXXX transmitting utilitydoing business as "" XXXX '', and so on ad infinitum. 

What they create, they control -- and they are obligated to pay for what they create and control. The ones with the gold pay the bills! 

USUFRUCT : A right to use another 's property for a time without damage or diminishing it, although the property might naturally deteriorate over time. A legal usufruct is one created by law. A 100 year encumbrance -- XXXX 7th, page 1542. 

Because of this "" usufruct '' relationship the United States has the hidden obligation and lawful responsibility to maintain everything we think we own. We were promised that on demand, but were never taught how to access it. The system made a promise that they could not and did not keep. We need to stop claiming ownership of everything we think we own and revert our interest back to the United States so they can put it in a trust for us ( which they may have already done ) so they can settle our claims. 

Our signature turns a piece of paper into a negotiable instrument because we are financial institutions considered to be estates patented under land patent because we come from the earth. They patented a "" usufruct '' interest in us. We are all agricultural beings, commodities. When you buy a house you 're not buying a house, you are creating a loan against yourself, you become the collateral for the loan. The land patent can not go to ground because its immovable. 

You are considered in law -- the international law of the XXXX -- as Liebercode Entities "" outside of '' and "" foreign '' to the United States. 

We 're our own estate on our debtor side, and considered to be a financial institution, so when you put your signature on any piece of paper you are considered to be a bank. They just take a piece of paper and overlay it on your signature, and write on that piece of paper, on top of your signature, your signature that authorizes a transaction that you never see. 

Then they place a lien against that signed piece of paper and sell it as a security on the stock exchange. This is what they 're doing with child support. They have you sign something so they can slap a lien on it and then sell it as notes no longer with them, a counterfeit security anyway, as there is nothing backing it and they 've obtained it through fraud, so they are anxious to put the obligation onto someone else so it relieves them of the obligation, becau"	Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response	BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION	FL	330XX		Consent provided	Web	2017-03-22	Closed with explanation	True	No	2399149

2017-04-04	Mortgage	Home equity loan or line of credit	Loan servicing, payments, escrow account		My husband bought a land lot in XXXX using a Bank of America home equity line of credit for {$82000.00} - in his name only - against our home, which is in both of our names, as a 2nd mortgage. For the next 10 years, he paid only interest payments. He died in XXXX of XXXX. The very next month after his death, the payments on the HELOC only went from {$340.00} / mo. to {$780.00} / mo. I tried to talk to BOA about refinancing the loan, but they would not because it was in his name only. I have submitted to BOA his death certificate and legal letters testamentary. These had no effect. I tried to go through XXXX, but Bank of America would not agree to be the secondary loan, because my name is not on the HELOC. But, I AM required to make the monthly payments on time. Since my name is on the original home mortgage ( with XXXX ), I have to pay. Also, they still take automatic deductions for a savings account that was in his name only, but will not let me access it. XXXX Mortgage worked for months trying to get BOA to agree to be the secondary loan, but I only spoke on the phone about this matter to my loan officers. There are no papers to attach regarding this. I have attached all relative papers I have.

2017-03-27	Mortgage	FHA mortgage	Loan modification,collection,foreclosure		"I worked hard and rebuilt my credit and saved money so that I could buy a home for my family with an FHA mortgage loan. My problem is that the mortgage company that holds my FHA loan Wells Fargo is not giving us a fair chance to resolve missed payments. They have given us conflicting information, told us after a review that we qualified but then later told us we do not, and advised us to miss payments so that we would qualify for help. We are now being told by Wells Fargo that there are no options except a short sale or deeding the house back to them -- but we just made two large lump sum payments in the last few months and they accepted these payments. How can we be in this situation? It does not make sense. I have enough income to afford the monthly payment, but was injured at work and out for a few months which is how this downward spiral started. 

In XXXX 2016 I hurt XXXX on my job as a XXXX ( been doing it for 27 years ) and found out that I had some XXXX and XXXX. I was out of work for three months, and even though I had some money saved fell behind one mortgage payment. My wife tried to call in to make the missed payment but Wells Fargo said we could not do that ; we could only pay the current month 's payment and would then be responsible for late fees. We were not able to get ahead because the way my business works I have to buy all the materials for a job in advance and then recoup this money when I get paid at completion. We called in to Wells Fargo to see if there were any programs to help us get caught up and spoke with XXXX at Wells Fargo. She went over our loan, our situation and our financial information and XXXX said that we qualified for help, but that we needed to be at least "" 3 months behind '' to qualify for these programs. At that time it was helpful for me to have extra money from missing two more payments so we followed her advice and then called in to apply after we were three months behind. We went over everything on the phone and once again were told we qualify and that all we had to do was send in the paperwork, which Wells Fargo said they would mail out. Of course they never sent it, and we actually had the paperwork sent to a Wells Fargo branch where we picked it up. 

We sent it to XXXX who told us she would have an answer for us in two weeks. We waited nearly two months, and were then told that we were denied and that we either had to short sale the house or give the house back to the bank. We were in shock. How was this possible?? 

I am not sure what programs we were reviewed for by Wells Fargo but XXXX XXXX had led us to believe it was Save your Home California. It appears this is a program offered by the state of California. Wells Fargo has government and internal modification programs available -- additionally, this is a government insured FHA loan. I am pretty sure that Wells Fargo is REQUIRED to consider us for modification, partial claim, forbearance agreement or repayment plan. It appears they did not review us for ANY of these programs. 

We make enough money to afford our mortgage payment. We have made two large lump sum payments to Wells Fargo ( that they ACCEPTED ) over the last 3 months to cut down our delinquency, yet Wells Fargo is telling us we have to give back our house while they take our payments??

THEY HAVE NO VALID CONTRACT WITH LAWFUL ELEMENTS OF CONTRACT,!!! THEIR RESPONSE IS TOTAL XXXX!!! TOTAL NONSENSE!!! 

SHOW ME A CURRENT VALID CONTRACT WITH MY WET INK SIGNATURE!!! 
SHOW IT TO ME!!!! AND STOP XXXX AROUND WITH YOUR TACTICTS OF CRIMINAL DECEPTIVE BEHAVIOR, THAT AINT MY XXXX DEBT AND YOU KNOW IT!!! 

PARTS OF A LAWFUL CONTRACT 1. Parties competent to contract The parties to a contract should be competent, being of the age of consent, of sound mind, not disqualified from contracting by any law to which s/he is subject. A flaw in capacity may be due to minority, lunacy, idiocy, drunkenness or kind. The parties should be of like kind, being either artificial Legal Entity and artificial Legal Entity, or living Man/Woman and living Man/Woman, allowing more than two parties but never a mixture of these kinds. 
2. Free and genuine consent The consent of the parties to the agreement must be free and genuine. The consent of the parties should not be obtained by misrepresentation, fraud, undue influence, coercion or mistake. If the consent is obtained by any of these means, then the contract is not valid or lawfully enforceable. 
3. Full disclosure When negotiating a contract, full disclosure is the act of providing all material information, or telling the "" whole truth '', about any matter which may influence the decision-making of the other party or parties before they decide to enter into a contract. 
4. Sufficient consideration The consideration is something of value possessed by the parties that is brought to the contract table. This something of value is bargained for and given in exchange for a promise or a performance. The parties must each receive a benefit and each suffer a detriment. To be enforceable, a contract must have sufficient consideration. A contract is unenforceable if it has insufficient or unequal consideration without agreement. 
5. Certainty of terms The Terms and Conditions of the contract must be fully disclosed and agreed upon, and must be certain and fixed, i.e. not variable as with interest rates. 
6. Meeting of the minds A meeting of the minds "" consensus ad idem '', occurs between the parties when they recognise each other, understand their mutual obligations, and agree. This meeting of minds can only occur between like kinds, being Legal Entity with Legal Entity, or Man/Woman with Man/Woman. A corporation and another corporation may enter into contract by way of accommodation parties, and a sentient being and another sentient being may enter into a contract directly, but a corporation and a sentient being together can not enter into a contract as they are not of the same and equal kind. 
7. Signatures or autographs Written contracts between Legal Entity actors must carry the wet ink signatures of the parties, each wet ink signature being anaccommodation from a Man/Woman.

2017-03-05	Mortgage	Conventional fixed mortgage	Loan servicing, payments, escrow account		"Condensed description : My wife XXXX and I married in XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX already had XXXX child, whose father was deceased. XXXX had her own XXXX and was doing well. She was making about {$XXXX} annually while I had a salary of about {$XXXX} a year. 
We soon bought a house ( XXXX ), Not long after that, XXXX 's father died. Rather than leave XXXX 's mother living alone on a country road some distance from our house, XXXX and I, in XX/XX/XXXX, bought a two-family house ( XXXX ) just XXXX short blocks from our house. XXXX 's mother and we would be within walking distance of each other. XXXX 's mother would live in the downstairs unit of XXXX and we would rent out the upstairs unit. 
XXXX and I spent some time and money improving the house. Then, unexpectedly and before XXXX 's mother could move in, XXXX 's mother died.. 

With XX/XX/XXXX came the financial crisis, dubbed "" The Great Recession. '' XXXX 's XXXX dropped precipitously and we had trouble finding renters for XXXX. XXXX had to close her business. We then had only my salary as income and XXXX mortgages and XXXX children. I applied for a mortgage modification on XXXX, but was turned down. We could find no tenants for XXXX, so it was vacant. Squatters soon moved into each apartment. 
I took the upstairs squatter to housing court to get her ordered out of the house, but the judge believed the lies that she and some tradesmen ( her friends ) told under oath. He ruled that she would be allowed to stay there until she had lived out, in rent, the approximately {$5900.00} that she claimed to have spent on repairs. 

XXXX developed a XXXX medical problem. 
XXXX put XXXX in my name only and then declared bankruptcy. That delayed foreclosure on XXXX for XXXX little while, but in XX/XX/XXXX, we received an eviction order at XXXX. 

I decided to try to get the squatters out of XXXX, so that we, now with XXXX children, would have a place to live after the eviction from XXXX. 
By my paying for a month 's worth of storage space for the XXXX squatter 's furniture and by my physically moving her furniture and other belongings, she agreed to leave the premises. 
That night, the night before our eviction was to take place, I. with help from a few relatives, managed to move our most essential belongings into the lower apartment of XXXX. Much had to be left behind, including appliances and food supplies. 

After our living in XXXX for a few weeks, I managed to get an eviction order for the upstairs squatter. Within two weeks she had moved out, doing only fixable damage in the process. That meant that our family 's space had doubled, so that each child could have a bedroom. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for a mortgage modification from our mortgage holder, Ocwen. I hoped that Ocwen would rather receive a smaller monthly payment ( than the originally agreed-upon amount ) instead of none ( the amount they were receiving while the squatters were there. I was wrong. I was told that the company "" does not do modifications.

I have read the explanation on nationstars ' website about the escrow amount going up. Still I can not fathom paying an additional {$430.00} a month. With the company making this change, our best bet to survive as a family will probably have to be to sell our home as we will not be able to make the payment of a nearly 50 % increase on our mortgage.

2017-03-05	Student loan	Non-federal student loan	Dealing with my lender or servicer	Trouble with how payments are handled	"On XX/XX/2017, I made a {$1000.00} credit card payment to my student loan provider, Navient ( ex XXXX ) and asked the customer service rep. to cover the total amount due ( {$580.00} ) and apply the amount left over ( {$410.00} ) to a specific loan, since that loan has the highest interest rate ( 4.25 % ) and it 's the smallest loan. Mysteriously, the amount left over was not applied to that loan, but rather to the largest loan ( {$32000.00} ) I have with the highest interest rate ( 4.25 % ). 
I pointed out the problem from XX/XX/2017 to another rep. on XX/XX/XXXX and she told me that the reallocation of {$410.00} from the highest loan to the smallest loan would be processed by XX/XX/2017. 
I messaged Navient 's live online messaging service on XX/XX/XXXX to explain the problem and the rep. told me that they were looking into it and that it should be reallocated by the following week. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I called to yet again follow up and also make another payment, but nothing regarding the misallocation from XX/XX/2017 had been done. I received no correspondence regarding this matter. I pointed out the problem to another rep. this time and he told me that the reallocation of {$410.00} from the smallest loan to the largest loan would be processed at the latest by XX/XX/2017. 
On XX/XX/2017, I called yet again regarding situation from XX/XX/2017 and also to make a further payment. I explained the situation to yet another rep. and received his permission to record our conversation, and then made a payment with him. After the payment, he transferred me to a manager, XXXX. He denied me permission to record our conversation. I was very distraught and explained to him why I was upset. I then threatened legal action and to write a formal complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau if I did n't receive some form of written correspondence telling me they were dealing with the situation by the end of that day. He acted tough and told me that the "" Monetary Department '' dealt with these matters and that no one from that department was in. I was on the telephone for 2 hours as both he and and the other rep. put me on hold "" looking '' for someone. 
After that phone call, the situation turned extremely weird. When I went to log into my online Navient account an hour later, the access was denied and I had to "" re-register '' with a new login-name and password. After re-registering, I noticed that, although I made a payment on that day ( XX/XX/2017 ) totaling {$700.00}, that sum was also never applied to my loans and the amount of my smallest loan actually increased by {$240.00} ; my payment "" disappeared '' and I have no idea what the increased amount of {$240.00} is. What happened here? 
Even though I CONTINUOUSLY call and ask for clarification, my requests are met with a lack of accountability and customer service representatives who seem to lie about my situation. I want to know where my money went and why more money has been added to one of my loans. 
I can prove all of this, since I record all correspondence and take before and after screenshots of my payments."		Navient Solutions, LLC.	MD	227XX		Consent provided	Web	2017-03-05	Closed with explanation	True	No	2372286

Parties competent to contract The parties to a contract should be competent, being of the age of consent, of sound mind, not disqualified from contracting by any law to which s/he is subject. A flaw in capacity may be due to minority, lunacy, idiocy, drunkenness or kind. The parties should be of like kind, being either artificial Legal Entity and artificial Legal Entity, or living Man/Woman and living Man/Woman, allowing more than two parties but never a mixture of these kinds. 
2. Free and genuine consent The consent of the parties to the agreement must be free and genuine. The consent of the parties should not be obtained by misrepresentation, fraud, undue influence, coercion or mistake. If the consent is obtained by any of these means, then the contract is not valid or lawfully enforceable. 
3. Full disclosure When negotiating a contract, full disclosure is the act of providing all material information, or telling the "" whole truth '', about any matter which may influence the decision-making of the other party or parties before they decide to enter into a contract. 
4. Sufficient consideration The consideration is something of value possessed by the parties that is brought to the contract table. This something of value is bargained for and given in exchange for a promise or a performance. The parties must each receive a benefit and each suffer a detriment. To be enforceable, a contract must have sufficient consideration. A contract is unenforceable if it has insufficient or unequal consideration without agreement. 
5. Certainty of terms The Terms and Conditions of the contract must be fully disclosed and agreed upon, and must be certain and fixed, i.e. not variable as with interest rates. 
6. Meeting of the minds A meeting of the minds "" consensus ad idem '', occurs between the parties when they recognise each other, understand their mutual obligations, and agree. This meeting of minds can only occur between like kinds, being Legal Entity with Legal Entity, or Man/Woman with Man/Woman. A corporation and another corporation may enter into contract by way of accommodation parties, and a sentient being and another sentient being may enter into a contract directly, but a corporation and a sentient being together can not enter into a contract as they are not of the same and equal kind. 
7. Signatures or autographs Written contracts between Legal Entity actors must carry the wet ink signatures of the parties, each wet ink signature being anaccommodation from a Man/Woman. Written contracts between living Men/Women must carry the wet ink autographs of the parties, and/or living identification such as a thumbprint. Living standing is recognised by a thumbprint, or more often by an unambiguous declaration with the autograph, such as authorised agent written below. 
8. Privity of contract A contract exists only between the parties. No third-party can obtain rights contained within a contract, or buy or sell a contract, without the express permission of the original parties.

2017-02-28	Credit card		Customer service / Customer relations		"We have had a checking account with Wells Fargo ( formerly Wachovia ) for nearly 15 years, during our last visit to the XXXX branch we were persuaded to take out a credit card which would 'even out expenses over the year '. I had to make a deposit of {$300.00} and was charged {$25.00} for the annual fee. When the card arrived I had a credit limit of {$300.00}, being the sum I paid in, which makes it a pre-paid account in my view. I have tried unsuccessfully for weeks to sort out the return of my {$300.00} and the closure of the account. 
I spoke to their customer services two weeks ago and said I wanted to return the {$300.00} to my checking account and close the credit card account. As I had a bill to pay I needed it straight away and so said I would take it as a cash advance and the chap said the 3 % fee would be waived and the account would be closed, using the collateral account to pay the cash advance amount. 

I logged on my account today to see that the credit card account is still active with a balance of {$310.00} and a payment of {$40.00} overdue."

The use of fictitious names or addresses ( ALL CAPITAL LETTERS XXXX in a private individual 's name, or a ZIP CODE, against the individual 's wishes, is a crime under Title 39 U.S.C.

As XXXX explains, the full capitalization of the letters of one 's natural name, results in a diminishing or complete loss of legal or citizenship status, wherein one actually becomes a slave or an item of inventory. The method, by which the State causes a natural person to "" volunteer '' himself into slavery, is through forming legal joinder, implied or stated, with the entity or legal fiction ( name all CAPS ). Of course, most natural persons would n't willingly form such an unlawful but legally reductionist joinder, so trickery and obfuscation are used ; and this starts when our birth certificates are created. 
[ The initial joinder is formed when a legal Birth Certificate is issued by the State, name in all CAPS. In fact, both the Certificate of Birth AND Social Security number, are for "" inventory '' control purposes, similar to the XXXX manifest or those numbers or records used by legal entities or Corporations to track, account for, use and dispose of inventory. ] Bank of America threatens me with extortion stating they will contract with chexsystems to promote negative information about me, this is a violation of my privacy and is another crime committed willfully and with intention!!

2017-04-06	Credit card		Advertising and marketing		"Signed up for an XXXX from Bank of America for the benefits XX/XX/XXXX. Received a reduced priced companion fare voucher as advertised, took a while to show up in the account. I was going to use the voucher issued to me before the expiration dateI logged in and noted it expired in XX/XX/XXXX. I was ready to purchase the tickets and suddenly the voucher was gone. 
I called XXXX, they said it had expired on the date of my anniversary XXXX, I was bummed, but when I asked, "" then where is the new voucher '' noting that it clearly states that you will receive a new voucher "" on the date of your account anniversary ''. They said to call Bank of America to see when it would arrive. 
I called Bank of America spoke with XXXX and XXXX and was told it indeed had expired. I said OK then, while I was pretty sure it had not, then where is the new voucher? I was told that "" it was issued on XXXX, but it takes some time to process into your account '' and it would be there next month on "" XXXX ''. I tried to verify what I was hearing that there was a voucher that has been issued but I do not have access to it until it is processed into my account. Which would mean it would expire in 12 months from issue and that I would be missing out on 1 months use. They said yes, I asked to escalate the issue as I did not see how this was correct and wanted access to the voucher that they said has been issued sooner. I explained that this appears to be an issue of false advertising, and that it appears that Bank of America and XXXX could be benefiting to the tune of millions of dollars by reducing the odds of the benefit being used for 1 month, for each of their millions of customers, year over year. 
Plus, I happen to know the 1 month to process a voucher code into an account is untrue. Based on the working with an online store that deals with vouchers, I understand what the process consists of. Technically speaking if they run a chron job to remove expired vouchers from accounts daily, they also could also be running daily chron job to deliver vouchers daily. It is not a manual process by any means. 
A week goes by and I called back to find out what happened to the escalation as I had not been called back. They asked me to explain my issue. I told them my escalation number and asked them to explain to me, what the issue was escalated. The Rep read the report and said that they had escalated to get my old voucher re-instated and that they had validated that the voucher did indeed expire and closed the complaint. I asked to speak with her supervisor, and was then speaking with Supervisor "" XXXX ''. We discussed the issue and she then said that the voucher would arrive on XXXX, and through the course of the conversation told me that my account had been credited with the voucher the day after I applied for the card on XX/XX/XXXX. She then proceeded to argue that the advertisement was in incorrect and that the terms and conditions state the voucher can be delivered 1-2 billing cycles after the anniversary date because of processing time. We discussed the issue of false advertising and she blamed XXXX telling me to take it up with them as to why it takes a month. I suggested that there must be an SLA agreement that you are legally bound to and that if you are advertising a benefit to a product and are not actually delivering it then there should be penalties. I asked to speak with her manager and am currently waiting for another callback."

2017-03-25	Mortgage	Other mortgage	Loan modification,collection,foreclosure		I am in the process of doing a deed in lieu and I am having a issue with the second mortgage Wells Fargo. I submitted paperwork to them that I had received from my first mortgage on XX/XX/2017 via fax. Instead of them reading the paperwork and acknowledging that it was a settlement offer from my first mortgage they removed me from their hardship program. I had to call them several times and have requested that they respond to the correspondence that was sent to them and advised myself and my first mortgage if they are going to accept the settlement offer. Since I sent the correspondence I have been assigned several representatives. The last one assigned to me XXXX, I sent her an email on XX/XX/XXXX to find out the status of the settlement offerr. She called me on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX and stated that she did not know the status but she would reach out to the processor and would call me back in 24 to 48 hours. It has been 8 business days since I spoke with her and have received no response. I also sent her an email for status on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and no response as of this date. Why is it taking so long for them to agree to the settlement offer. This is the only thing that is needed for my first mortgage to conclude my deed in lieu.

2017-03-05	Credit card		Delinquent account		"I transferred a balance to Chase Slate in the amount of {$1000.00} and chose to enroll in autopay from there website. After receiving confirmation that the auto pay was accepted i then found out that, due to data entry on the credit card company 's, part they did not accept my bank account number. They called me and told me there was a problem with the auto pay and my bank account was not accepted. They then told me to go back online and reconfirm that the data was correct. After i confirmed that my information was correct and paid the minimum amount due, the next month i received a statement telling me that only the minimum amount was due in the amount of {$30.00}. I then, at the same month and time frame received a recorded phone call from the company telling me i am delinquent on my account. When i called to inquire about the situation they told me again that my bank account was not accepted, that i was over the limit and also three months behind on my payments. 

I once again whet online to only confirm once again that my information was correct. I aslo confirmed that they discontinued my card and reported me for late payment to the three major credit report agencies. 

Also, after i paid the late amount and total amount due that was behind, the next day i was informed by the auto phone with the company that i was still late. When i asked and inquired if they reported me for no fault of my own, the response was they were having problems with there computer system. 

I would like to report three accounts of fraud : 1. Sending a false or inaccurate monthly statement that stated only the minimum amount was due when they then informed me that i was three months in the rears. 
2. Reporting me to the credit report agencies for late payment when they admitted they were having problems with there computer system and the error was clearly on their part. 
3. Misuse of personnel information : my bank account number and intentional data entry error and/or gross negligence, in attempt to collect more money by falsifying the amount do with the intention to collect more money from me."

2017-03-06	Mortgage	Conventional fixed mortgage	Loan servicing, payments, escrow account		"We closed on our loan in XX/XX/2015. A short time later it was sold and started to be serviced by Ditech. That was the beginning of the worst customer service experience of my life. When our property taxes were due, I checked my account and saw that they were not being paid. Of course, the money had been escrowed on time but no payment was being made for taxes. I sent an email to their customer service to find out what was happening. I got a standard letter within a week telling me they would look into it and I could expect an answer within 30 days. I tried waiting patiently but as I checked my account with the town, I saw interest starting to be added because the payment was so late. So, this time I called the customer service number and after being transferred a few times spoke with someone in that department. 

The rep told me that they were n't being paid because my town needed to send them something to prompt payment and once that happened, they would be paid. So I checked with my town and they told me the same thing was sent to Ditech that is sent to all other mortgage servicing companies. Here we go. I call Ditech again and have to start all over as they do n't seem to have record of my previous inquiries. What happens next? I get another form letter exactly like the last one telling me they will look into it. Still no tax payment and interest keep getting added. Again, I try to wait but my husband ends up calling and finds out that from who he talked to that the problem was that our account was not set up correctly. It was marked as a "" self-pay '' for taxes even though they have been collecting our money for escrow every month. OK, so mistakes happen, I just wanted it fixed and to get those taxes paid as we were now a few months late. 

I contacted the town again and told them what was happening and they told me they would let me know once they received payment. Great. Payment was finally made but Ditech used my escrow money to pay the interest that had accrued from being so late!!! What?? They made an administrative error in setting up our account yet they used our money to correct their error? That is just unacceptable. So, my husband called again and the rep he spoke with that time told him she saw everything in their system and she would put the request in to refund us the money taken from our account to pay the interest. Great, that is all I wanted. Weeks go by and nothing. 

Finally, my husband called back and they said the request was denied. Seriously??? So I sent one final email because I wanted it in written form and told them how miserable their customer service was and that I would give them 14 days to make this right or I would begin to explore other avenues to file a complaint. What do I get? Another form letter to tell me they would look into and I would have a response within 30 days. That was in late XX/XX/XXXX and it is now XX/XX/XXXX and I have gotten no refund and no response. They have got to be the absolute worst in customer service I have ever seen. It is unfortunate you can not choose who services your loan because if you could, I would not go near this company ever again."

It was not on any other statement or sent as a message in the online banking system, so there was no way to assure that people were aware of this change which would impact them, I consider it a bait and switch. With the push for paperless statements, which you have to pay otherwise, a dedicated message should be sent to people through the online system in the months leading up to a change that will cost the account holder money.

2017-03-06	Debt collection	Other (i.e. phone, health club, etc.)	Communication tactics	Threatened to take legal action	"ABOUT MY COMPANY XXXX has been in business for over 35 years. XXXX. About 70 % of our business occurs during XXXX through XXXX and we are approaching our busy time frame. 

BACKGROUND ON THE HARASSMENT CALL Today I received a phone call from XXXX ( representing their client who is CIT Group ) located in XXXX NY asking me to expedite a payment of over {$3600.00} by the end of this week ; as of today XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I now owe them about {$23000.00}. The original agreement I proposed to them on XXXX XXXX, XXXX was... 

- {$750.00} every 2 weeks thru XXXX - {$3500.00} every month XXXX thru XXXX Then I asked XXXX if I could reduce the first part of the payment from {$750.00} to a range of $ XXXX {$500.00} every 2 weeks. No one ever got back to me I have paid between {$300.00} and {$500.00} since XXXX ; they cashed all of the checks without telling me that those checks were not acceptable but by cashing the checks it led me to believe that XXXX, acting on behalf of their client, agreed to the payment plan that I was making. So I am thinking everything is fine with the payments until I get a call today that they wanted to step up the payments and need a check by this Friday XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The person I spoke to, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, threatened me with legal action if I do n't sign the payment plan by the end of today Monday XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I told them how can you call me and request an immediate payment by the end of the week and no one at the collection agency mentioned this to me WHEN THEY WERE CASHING THE CHECKS. They had more than enough time to call me in XXXX and XXXX XXXX to let me know those payments were not good enough. If I had known that they were going to do this I would have changed the timing of paying my other vendor bills. I told XXXX that if she filed legal action against my company I would go out of business because my credit would be ruined and all she said was if you do n't sign the payment agreement you will be sued because her client has to be paid ; I told her she was being very rude and she said I was yelling at her. AND THEN SHE TOLD ME IF I DON '' T STOP YELLING SHE WOULD HANG UP THE PHONE ON ME AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT SHE DID. Yes I did raise my voice and I told her what would you do if you are being threatened with legal action. I also asked XXXX why ca n't she wait until XXXX to start receiving the higher payments of {$3500.00} per month and she said 60 days is too long. Originally I wanted to start paying {$3500.00} in XXXX but XXXX would be more realistic for my company - I feel very comfortable with this payment plan. 

The other issue I explained to her is that my Bank XXXX XXXX has agreed to a 6 month payment deferral on my loan used to purchase the business in XXXX XXXX. They see the value in the business and have agreed to work with me to get out of this situation. XXXX did not want to hear anything about that. 

XXXX XXXX was very unprofessional especially when she threatened me with legal action. It is quite surprising that a company such as C I T GROUP COMMERCIAL would choose an unprofessional company like XXXX to represent them. 

HOW WE GOT BEHIND ON OUR BILLS I got into this situation because one of my XXXX in XXXX / XXXX XXXX which caused my company to lose over {$200000.00} in XXXX and lost business. We had nothing to do with the XXXX but that XXXX was not willing to make up for it by giving us discounts on what we owed him for the work that he did. Most of out vendors are working with us as we get through this obstacle that we have no control over. 

OUR BUSINESS FUNDAMENTALS ARE STRONG Despite this issue our business fundamentals are strong and we have not lost a single customer ; in addition to that we are picking up new customers almost daily."

Ocwen Loan Servicing LLC, N.J. Super. App. Div. ( per curiam ) ( XXXX pp. ) Plaintiff XXXX XXXX. XXXX appealed an order dismissing his XXXX-count amended complaint for failure to state a claim. The appellate panel affirmed the dismissal with the exception of XXXX counts. Plaintiff filed the complaint against defendants Ocwen Loan Servicing LLC and XXXX as Trustee. The complaint alleged that over the course of 22 years, defendants engaged in a pattern of misconduct by refusing to accept plaintiff 's mortgage payments in order to claim default and file frivolous foreclosure actions against him. The first count surviving dismissal alleges that plaintiff made mortgage payments and paid insurance premiums over a lengthy period of time without receiving proper credit, defendants failed to pay real estate taxes funded by plaintiff 's mortgage payments, and defendants charged plaintiff for insurance premiums that were improper and never credited. Moreover, plaintiff could not challenge the alleged amount due because defendants dismissed the foreclosure action. The appellate panel found that this count alleges valid claim for an accounting and reversed the court 's order dismissing it. The second count surviving dismissal alleges that defendants engaged in a course of deceitful and unconscionable conduct in their efforts to enforce and collect the sums due under plaintiff 's loan. The actions alleged included failing to accept and credit plaintiff 's mortgage payments in order to falsely claim he was in default, and demanding payments for premiums and other purported costs that were improper. Those allegations were sufficient to state a claim under the Consumer Fraud Act that defendants engaged in unconscionable loan collection practices. The panel reversed the court 's dismissal of that claim. The panel noted that, despite defendants claims otherwise, loan collection efforts undertaken by the "" lender or its assignee '' fall within the protections of the CFA."

So, when the payment was returned on XXXX XXXX 2015, from a hardly used bank account, i called and was finally given permission to change the bank account on my loan. The lender charged me the {$15.00} NSF and withdrew the loan amount from the correct bank account on XXXX XXXX, 2015. I made my regular loan pymt on XXXX XXXX, 2015. Because the lender does not issues statements nor send out email statements, I had to go to the website to see what my balance was. Their website does not display the balance either. There is no way you can find out the balance on your account unless you call the lender. While looking at the breakdown of my last XXXX payments, I saw that they lender had taken the entire {$380.00}, totaling {$770.00}, and applied it straight towards the principal. When i contacted to lender to ask them why, I was told that, because my payment was returned in XXXX, I had to "" catch up '' on the interest for that month and basically pay the interest in advance for XXXX as well. I explained to the rep that there was no "" catch up '' interest clause in my contract being that I had made the payment in XXXX as I was suppose to and that I did not see what XXXX had to do with XXXX. I then requested to have monthly statements either mailed or emailed to me so that I could have a record of both my payments and my balance because it did not seem to be moving. The rep informed me that the company does not give statements. I asked her how could a consumer keep track of their balance/payments if nothing was offered to show them what was going on with their account? She sent me a break down of my last payment.

2017-04-13	Credit card		Credit card protection / Debt protection		"I signed up for the XXXX card offered by Barclay due to its SCRA benefits for XXXX service members and its great incentives offered to Military members. It guaranteed $ 0 yearly fees and 0 % interest for the entirety of my XXXX military service contract. At no time in my original communications through the SCRA division of Barclay Bank, did they state that the $ 0/0 % interest would not apply for XXXX members but for members who joined after they had an already established account with Barclay Bank. In addition, it did not state that it had the right to change the terms of its contracts at any time. This was a very deceitful offer and it now feels like a "" BAIT AND SWITCH '' scam and I 'm sure to many XXXX Military members who have this card as well. No warning of the disestablishment of the SCRA benefits for XXXX members was in the process of being implemented was ever given to myself via email, letter, or message in my account prior to it just being all of a sudden taken away. The company has maintained that it will allow me to retain my 0 % interest but the yearly fees of {$990.00} plus {$290.00} for each additional card will be implemented is unsatisfactory to me. At a minimum, current card holders under the original terms should be grandfathered but any new members should be fully aware that the yearly fees apply. This whole process has left a very sour taste in my mouth as I have reached out and left a message to their customer service number ( XXXX ) with no reply within 48 hours as it states. In addition, I have left a message through my credit card account with no response as well. I finally today was able to contact an Executive Specialist, with the Office of the President at Barclay Cards USA and she clearly stated that it was their right to change the terms of their contracts to align with business practices ( other credit card companies ) around them with no warning to the card members. She also stated that at this time, they are not offering any other services to satisfy the card member or to help to maintain the business of the card member. She stated that before my one year mark with the company that they "" Should '' be reviewing accounts to see if any of their current offers apply and if not then at the year mark the yearly fees would be charged to my account. I asked if I could be switched to either their Black Card or Titanium card, due to their yearly fees not being near as much as the Gold Card and I do n't feel like I should wait till XXXX to see if I qualify for offers at that time. This is unsatisfactory and I felt was completely communicated wrong from the very beginning. In addition, I feel that I should be grandfathered in with my original terms or allowed to switch to another one of their cards immediately and not have to wait for my account to be reviewed one month prior to my year mark with this company. I began this process wanting to stay with Barclay services but after my conversation with the Executive Specialist, I am now leaning towards terminating any further business with Barclay Bank and refraining from any future business through them as well."

I have never missed a payment since I was required to start paying off my loan, starting XXXX 2009. I graduated XXXX 2009 from XXXX XXXX. 

Since then I have paid a little over {$200.00} each month. 

The original principal balance of my loan was {$15000.00}. 

$ XXXX/month since XXXX 2009 to Present = 91 months total of never missing a payment @ $ XXXX/month = {$18000.00} I have already paid over {$18000.00} back into my loan, yet the principal balance on my loan has only decreased from {$15000.00} to roughly {$13000.00} now. 

This is ridiculous and should be considered a crime. 

I understand what interest is and how it works, but really?! My loan has only decreased {$2000.00} despite paying back the loan in full and more over the past 7 years?!

2016-05-05	Debt collection	I do not know	Disclosure verification of debt	Right to dispute notice not received	"About 2 months ago, upon getting a notification from XXXX XXXX that there had been a change on my credit report, i discovered a collections account listed as Plusfour for {$25.00}. I immediately proceeded to look up the company and contact them to resolve the issue, as quickly as possible, since I had never been contacted by them nor did I know what this outstanding debt was for. When I spoke to a representative I confirmed my address ( which was incorrect in their system since I had recently moved XXXX ) as well as my phone number, which was still the same. At that time she informed me she could not discuss my account with me because I was no longer a XXXX resident and they were not licensed XXXX. I told her I understood and asked what i needed to do to proceed. She said they would be transferring my account to a company that was licensed XXXX and that it could be XXXX5 days. I waited almost two week and then called Plusfour again because I had still not heard from anyone and I was eager to resolve this, since this was still a negative remark on my credit score that had lowered my score by XXXX points. Once again I was told that they could not discuss my account because I resided XXXX, but the representative did provide me with the phone number with the company that was now handling my account. I went ahead and contacted the XXXX Debt company and was told by the representative that according to her records they did not have any outstanding accounts associated with my name, SSN or phone number. Once again I called Plusfour this time to inform them that the company whose phone they gave said there were no accounts for me. She verified that she gave me the correct information, which she had. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told he was not in but that he he would review my account, contact the colorado company and then follow up with me, which he never did. 

Almost 2 months have gone by and I have still never been contacted by anyone in order to resolve this issue. As someone with a credit score over XXXX who has never had an account in Collections before this, I am now infiruated that this negative remark is still on my credit report and that although I have done everything in my power to find out what it is about or how to resolve it, i have been unable to. Plus XXXX never called me once in regards to this account before reporting it to the credit bureau, in fact they 've never called me at all. I would have resolved it before it ever got to this point."		PlusFour, Inc	CO	804XX		Consent provided	Web	2016-05-05	Closed with explanation	False	No	1911573

Recently I made an inquiry to the lender to payoff the balance and possibly transfer the car to a family member. However, according BMW Financial Services, they will not be releasing the title to me upon receiving payoff, due to outstanding ( unfinished ) recall. Upon further discussion with the manufacture and dealer, I was told that, although the recall notice was sent to me in XX/XX/XXXX, about a year ago, the dealership can not complete the repair due to parts shortage. Furthermore, I was informed by BMW today that the soonest I can receive the parts is XXXX, another 6-7 months from now. The reason for the lender 's refusal to release title was referred to NHTSA 's Stop Sells order related to the recall. However, I can not find any information from NHTSA that prevents the lender to release clean title. It is NOT a sale, simply a loan pay-off. 

I feel it is unreasonable for a lender to withhold title even after receiving full payment."		BMW Financial Services NA, LLC	NC	282XX	Older American	Consent provided	Web	2017-03-06	Closed with explanation	True	No	2366157

During the processing, I noted to their mortgage officer XXXX XXXX, and, processior XXXX XXXX, that I am always on the trip, so best way to reach me is by emailing. 
Till to the mortgage was approved, everything working perfect, and I finally got my loan. 
I start to mail the mortgage payments by mailing checkes, start from XXXX XXXX until XXXX XXXX. 
At that 8 months, I try to set up the auto pay to avoid any delay or XXXX payments, and wrote email to XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX to ask the situation of my mortgage statements, and how to set up payments. 
Since I am out side of States, I have my real eastate agent, XXXX XXXX to ggive them calls almost every month to help me set up autopay account. 
Non of them reply by email, or pick up phones. 
So, I left my checks to my office, and my people help to mail check every month like usual. 

Until, XXXX XXXX XXXX, I back to U.S from a long trip, I got a goodby mail from UAMC ( the universal American Mortgage Company ), said my loan was sold on XX/XX/XXXX! 
And, I received a voicemail from PennyMac ( the new lender ), I was four months delay on my mortgage payments already! 
So, I called XXXX three time to verify what 's happening, and make payments in 10 days. 

At that moment, I put out all my bank statement and found my checks were transferred to pennymac for several times. And, there XXXX checks were missed, and might be XXXX was refused to transfer by Universal American Mortgage Company. 
I called UAMC service office, and try to work out how many payments they received, and why has nobody can reply my emails, and loan officerhad not been able to pick up phone calls from us ( which they frequently talked before this loan was approved ). 

I was told by UAMC that my loan was sold, and they are not be going to answer my any further questions. Yes, and even I called them on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, aksing a records of my payments, try to figure out how many checks did they forwarded,. 
NO BODY give me a call back, because I was sold! 

XXXX XXXX people even has a little bit professional mind, they should notice it, and inform me my loan was transferred. 
Which I am completely okay with that! 
NO Calls, NO picking up calls, NO replying emails, NOt taking care of customer 's re requirements. All my mortgage issues massed up, and my credit score is terriable. 
In that 8 months, I honestly mailed checks every single month, no missed. 

I paid the late pay fees, because I understand it 's not XXXX 's mistakes. 
But, I am really have questions for UAMC, how could they take care of their customers, and how they people feeling kind of massing! 

I wish you can fix my credit score! 
I wish you could talk to them, since no one care aboutme from UAMC.

2017-03-02	Consumer Loan	Vehicle lease	Problems when you are unable to pay		I was a cosigner on a vehicle lease. Apparently the lease vehicle was returned by the person who was leasing the vehicle and a payment plan was set up with Ford Motor Company credit to pay the difference. I was never informed that this action was taking place or that there was any danger of a collection account showing up on my credit report. As a cosigner I was given no opportunity to intervene prior to this being reported to the credit agency. Further I was never notified that this was reported to the Credit Agencies. According to the person that I co-signed with Ford Motor Company gave the impression that no credit action will be taken so long as payments are made on time per their monthly payment agreement. Therefore the person whom I co-signed for felt that there was no issue to worry about.		FORD MOTOR CREDIT CO.	NY	100XX		Consent provided	Web	2017-03-06	Closed with explanation	True	No	2366764

2017-03-06	Credit card		Rewards		Received an offer from Chase Bank for a Southwest Air Lines Rapid Rewards Credit Card. Offer included a bonus of XXXX points after spending {$1000.00} in charges in the first 3 months. I spend the required amount plus some in the first 2 months, then waited the required 1 or 2 statement cycles for my XXXX points to show up, when they did not appear I contacted Chase Bank. They told me I did not apply for a XXXX point card but one that gave XXXX points and that is was to late for them to do anything, had I contacted them 3 months ago when they first put in XXXX points they might have been able to do something and that it would be unfair to their other customers to fix their problem. I informed them I did not, would not waste my time applying for a card with only XXXX points. I told them this 4 times in 4 different secure communications. They have refused to do anything about this. I did not apply for anything but the card with XXXX points. I will accept nothing less than the XXXX points in the offer they made or the refunding of my credit card fee they charged.

2017-02-14	Student loan	Non-federal student loan	Getting a loan	Can't qualify for a loan	Hello : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, I consolidate my student loans. Than XX/XX/XXXX I received a notice that my student loan for {$7100.00} was being collected by a collection agency. When I spoke to the agency, they would not work with me, they wanted payment in full or they would garnish my wages. I could not get a loan or borrow this amount, so my wages were garnished. XX/XX/XXXX the account was paid and my wages were no longer garnished. As of this morning, I ran a credit report and it shows that National Collegiate Trust as me in collections starting XX/XX/XXXX is the amount above and it is not paid. I contacted the agency reference as collection agency XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX, they indicate my account was turned back over to National Collegiate Trust XX/XX/XXXX with no other status they could provide me. I am lost as to how to get this removed from my credit or show it has been paid in full on my credit. I am trying to buy a house and I am being denied for this account.

2017-03-22	Bank account or service	Checking account	Deposits and withdrawals		My husband lost his bank card and didnt know it. Navy Federal sent my him a text in regards to a {$8.00} purchase and that was it. Once we were able to check our account there had been XXXX transactions conducted with his card and a pin number over the course of 3 days. This an account that my husband and I solely have for the purpose of us saving money. This is the only joint account we have and do n't use it on a daily basis at all. The XXXX transactions consisted of XXXX checks being written to my husband and deposited into our account. Of course it later came back that the checks were not legit. So at this time Navy Federal is saying that my husband and I are responsible for the estimated {$2000.00} overdrafts in our checking and savings account. Due to the fact that the transactions were done by a pin number they are basically saying that they have done their investigation and we are liable. The fact that checks were not signed by my husband, location of the transactions and the irregular amount of transactions conducted in such a short time frame was not taking under consideration. So almost every Navy Federal calls myself or my husband seeking payment for these fraudulent actives that has occurred to our bank account. I honestly believe that it maybe a Navy Federal employee who did this due to the fact that fake Navy Federal checks were used and that they had some way of getting my husbands pin number or even able to manipulate the system in to believe its my husbands pin. My husband did not write his pin number down or give it to anybody. He uses the same pin number for all of his accounts so there is no need to write it down which Navy Federal is assuming happened or that he gave it to someone. I his wife is the only other person who knows this pin number. So needless to say DO NOT TRUST NAVY FEDERAL WITH YOUR MONEY!!!! They have done absolutely nothing to help me resolve this issue but give me the run around and play games. I get new and different answers every time I call and they refuse to let me speak to a supervisor, investigator, or security personnel to help me understand how they came up with the conclusion in which they did.

2017-03-06	Debt collection	I do not know	Communication tactics	Frequent or repeated calls	This Taurus Law Group calls several times daily, not only me, but also family members of mine. The messages they leave say that there is an important message from Taurus Law Group and to contact XXXX XXXX ( not sure of name spelling ) at XXXX. The message sounds recorded and is exactly the same every time. They do not say who they are attempting to contact, but do say that they are a debt collector and that any information obtained will be used for that purpose. They have been asked to stop calling. I feel that they are implying legal action and by not identifying who they are attempting to contact, scare people into calling them back. This leads me to believe that if a family member does return the call that they would discuss any alleged debt with a third party in order to obtain information illegally.		Taurus Law Group, P.C.

I never received a response, and when I attempted to reach them via phone, I was only put on hold and no one answered my call, despite their claim that they 're available 24/7. Because I could not contact them, I stopped payment on the next {$350.00} withdrawal and again attempted to contact them via phone, to no avail. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent them another email stating that I had missed my previous payment due to financial hardship, and that I wanted to work out a payment plan and had paid {$700.00} already, but again, no response save for an automated email which directed me to call if I had n't heard back from them. Again, could not get a real person. I realize that this is a debt I owe, but I feel I was misled regarding the payment amounts and am frustrated with the lack of ability to communicate with this company. I am also unable to look at anything regarding my account online because it is past due, so I ca n't view the disclosures at all. This company is predatory and unreliable.

2017-03-06	Credit reporting		Unable to get credit report/credit score	Problem getting my free annual report	"On XX/XX/2017 I filed an online request with Innovis Event # XXXX ( Proof of Address copy attached pg2 ) requested a free annual credit report. I never received the report. 
On XX/XX/2017 I called Innovis ' toll free line from a number they have in my credit file. I informed the CSR ( XXXX or XXXX ) that I had not received my report. We determined that it was not forwarded from my Arizona address to my Colorado address. He told me that they could only send the report to a verified address and said I could send a PO Box receipt for the new address by fax to Innovis with the event number. 
On XX/XX/2017 I sent a copy of my USPS box renewal notice with my name and current PO Box number to Innovis via fax. I also included a copy an envelope from my insurance company showing my name and the previous AZ address being forwarded to my current PO Box ( see Proof of Address - pg1 ). 
On XX/XX/2017 I received an unsigned letter from Innovis ( "" Innovis Letter '' attached ) acknowledging that Innovis had received my fax of Proof of Address but required XXXX "" of the acceptable forms of proof documentation reflecting your current mailing address ''. XXXX of the documents options that the Letter lists is a "" Post Office Box Receipt ''. Since I already sent the official renewal invoice from my new PO Box , I have already verified the address as mine. 
It is unclear why Innovis believes that the US Post Office can not be trusted to properly vet persons that forward mail. I have not found that to be the case. In fact other major credit reporting agencies have not restricted forwarding of my credit report by the US Post Office to the same PO Box I have verified for Innovis. There is no justification for further delays in delivering my credit report to my verified mail address."		Innovis	CO	801XX		Consent provided	Web	2017-03-06	Closed with explanation	True	Yes	2372025

2017-03-06	Mortgage	Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM)	Loan servicing, payments, escrow account		"My husband and I are XXXX and we recently had an issue with our mortgage payment. While we had been overpaying our mortgage for the last 2 years, a change in the monthly escrow payment in XX/XX/XXXX resulted in an underpayment situation. While we were paying our mortgage payment each month, we were slightly off ( XXXX-XXXX USD ), and as a result our credit report now reflects two 30 day late payments. To be clear, we sent our mortgage payment each month, but because it was not the right amount TD Bank marked us as late until they received the next month 's payment to apply the additional {$20.00} needed. TD Bank sent notifications of the change in escrow, not to the right address. From talking to two separate TD Bank reps I understand in our account notes it shows a long history of returned mail since XX/XX/2016. Despite this mail being returned TD Bank did not call our telephone numbers on file or email us. Since initiating the dispute I looked at my account online and found I HAD updated our address online, but TD Bank required I send this request in formal writing. I did not see that request in my online account message board. 

In the attached paperwork you will see we requested TD Bank remove the two 30 day late records- based on the mail issue, the fact we were sending in payments on time, just the wrong amount, and our history of timely payments that were in fact over-payments, vice under. We also attached XXXX ( like XXXX ) explaining we are XXXX, which helps to explain why we were n't getting the mail. This is an important issue to us, as our credit scores had been XXXX, and now they have dropped significantly. 

Depite all this paper work TD Bank refused to remove the two 30 day late notices. I believe they should remove these notices as : we had updated our address online, but their system did not reflect same ; we had a positive overpayment history with this mortgage ; and TD Bank made NO EFFORT to contact us via the valid telephone numbers and email addresses online, dispite getting all correspondence returned to them. 
We appreciate your attention in this matter. Please advise if you need any other information from me. Regards, XXXX XXXX"		TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY	AE	097XX		Consent provided	Web	2017-03-06	Closed with non-monetary relief	True	No	2372527

The evidence overwhelmingly proves that XXXX payments, with correct account numbers, were made before the due date. BoA failed to process them and can not explain why. BoA stills owes me nearly {$79.00}. BoA 's argument is disjointed and contradictory. On one hand they claim they can not locate any checks and on the other they claim the checks contained incorrect account numbers. Which is it? The alleged {$29.00} credit was made and later retracted. Thus no reimbursement occurred. They still owe me approximately {$75.00}.

They are now calling my personal phone and anyone they can at my employer. I have requested they not call here due to my employers policy against this sort of inquiries. I requested they send me the info about this matter. FDCPA states they have 5 days. Lady on phone argued it was 30 and asked why in never responded to any of the paperwork they sent. I informed her that i never received anything from them. A gentleman i talked to yesterday stated this was about a breech of contract, but the lady today stated this was a lawsuit and an attempt to gain asset info from my employer to garnish wages, all while trying to strong arm and intimidate me. She seemed to have no concern or knowledge of this FDCPA regs. She didnt state the company name, reason, anything of that sort. All required per FDCPA. She also told me i needed to get another lawyer as my current lawyer doesnt know anything. I was told from the gentleman the other day that the name of their company ( which i had to ask for ) was XXXX.

2017-04-10	Bank account or service	Checking account	Account opening, closing, or management		"Summary of Events : Towards the end of XX/XX/XXXX I had seen an advertisement for Wells Fargo, and was looking for a financial institution closer to home as my bank is quite a few miles down the road, and Wells Fargo being there is a branch close to me I decided to give it a chance. I went online and received a document required to be signed and submitted which was done by XXXX of the XXXX, OR. Branch. Later I had received a survey from Wells Fargo asking me to fill it out. I did so voluntarily as I felt that XXXX did only what was asked and did not provide me any offers such as Savings, Credit, etc. Later, I opened other credit elsewhere. I filled out the survey honestly. I had an issue, question and had to get a temporary card so I was back in the branch in XXXX about 2-3 times. One of the, if not the most recent inside visit was a Friday I visited the branch, the manager XXXX spoke with me quite harshly, and adamantly about the survey I had submitted. Her exact words were 'You know these kinds of things look bad upon us. '' In reference to my below par voluntary survey. I left and came home and had first noticed on my phone an email I recognized the evening that I opened my account with Wells Fargo. Inquisitive about the email I checked my account and seen not only the one I signed up for, but yet another second account. At that exact moment I called XXXX and asked for XXXX and complained about the 2nd account, and advised her of the suspicious emails I received when I opened my original account. She suggested I come in to the branch the next day. The next day was a Saturday when I had to visit a post office, and being that the local post offices to me are closed on Saturday in XXXX and XXXX, while out in XXXX I visited the XXXX branch and spoke with the manager there who looked up the account details, and I advised him of what had occurred and all interactions, and he then contacted Customer Service, and was informed that there was a hold on the account, and he was transferred to different departments including Online Banking Customer support, whom he asked if they could remove the hold on the account so it could be closed as it was not opened by the account holder nor was it authorized whatsoever. The manager at XXXX, close to XXXX, found out that he could n't remove the hold, customer care could n't remove the hold, and so he contacted XXXX, and apparently XXXX the manager there was able to remove the hold which clearly was opened by an employee if not XXXX at the XXXX branch which I believe was clearly vindictive due to the fact of the poor survey, and my other proof is the fact that only, XXXX was able to remove the hold on the account so the account could be removed by the manager at the XXXX branch. After this concern I requested that the account be closed as if it was never opened in the first place, as I tend to watch, protect, and respect my credit very well, and the second account without any prior authorization from me ; the account holder, is just clearly unacceptable behavior of a bank/financial institution in the United States, especially whom are apparently FDIC protected & trusted to protect my financial and private information. Where is the protection? I feel violated by Wells Fargo 's actions which clearly was either a glitch or intentional or all of the above. 
It is quite suspicious that the exact same evening that I come home from the XXXX Branch, and after given the third degree from the manager there regarding a voluntary survey -- I call that quite clearly vindictive behavior, and to me that seems like a fireable offense, but I leave that to Wells Fargo to handle."

2017-04-14	Bank account or service	Other bank product/service	Making/receiving payments, sending money		"BACKGROUND : Late on the evening of XX/XX/2017, I saw two payments pending in online banking of my XXXX checking account, both of which were NOT MINE. These pending payments totaled {$12000.00} : One to XXXX for {$7500.00} ; and one to Wells Fargo in the amount of {$5300.00}. I initially planned on going to my branch the next morning, but then in the wee hours of XX/XX/2017, decided to call XXXX XXXX number to alert them. After talking to various departments, the third department told me that the Claims Dept. was closed, and told me "" you 'll have to call back tomorrow. '' When I called the next morning, the Claims Dept. told me the payments were already disbursed, and it was too late to stop them! I assumed XXXX would make good on these fraudulent payments, but their Claims Dept. rejected my claim, saying that my phone had been used to make the payments. My XXXX banker intervened for me, to no avail. So I complained to the Better Business Bureau. I was then contacted by XXXX from XXXX Executive Office, who told me he would investigate my claim. XXXX concluded that XXXX position of denying my claim was unchanged, but as a courtesy, they requested XXXX to reverse the online payment to them, which they did, and I recovered that {$7500.00} payment. XXXX said they were not given the option to reverse the payment to Wells Fargo for {$5300.00}, and suggested I pursue that matter on my own. So he provided me with the WELLS FARGO A/C NO. XXXX, so that I could pursue the {$5300.00} fraudulent payment that went into that account from my XXXX account. 
WELLS FARGO EVENTS : Wells Fargo has not helped me, and concluded that they have done all they 're going to do, and told me that I 'd have to pursue the matter with XXXX. A Wells Fargo representative named "" XXXX '' ( who works with or under XXXX in their Executive Services Dept. did provide me with a Wells Fargo email address that only law enforcement ( i.e. the XXXX ( Fla. ) Police Dept. ) to correspond with.

Why has BOA allow XXXX days to pass from the date they were eligible to proceed with judgement ( XX/XX/XXXX ) to the date the judgment was recently filed ( XX/XX/XXXX )? For what reason did BOA wait XXXX days to file the judgement? 
2.Why did BOA never respond to my written inquiry on XX/XX/XXXX ( mailed to XXXX FL, XXXX ). This is a violation on RESPA, and was never addressed. 
3. Why did BOA charge my mortgage account 19 times for the same property inspection fee on XX/XX/XXXX? This is a violation of FDCPA 15 U.S.C, 1692e ( 2 ) 4.On XX/XX/XXXX, Superior Court of Delaware issued a letter indicating they were going to dismiss the foreclosure case due to lack of judgment entered. Was BOA aware that this foreclosure case was about to be dismissed for lack of follow up with their vendor attorney? 
5. On what dates did BOA follow up with XXXX for a foreclosure case updated? List all dates. 
6. Did BOA receive a copy of the superior court letter from XX/XX/XXXX? 
7. For what reason did BOA file an amended foreclosure complaint on XX/XX/XXXX? 
8. Why was the correct mortgage rate not calculated per the loan agreement ( in the foreclosure complaint )? Your response indicated "" your research has uncovered no reasonable factual basis to substantiate your claim ''. Allow me to clarify ; in the amended complaint, BOA charged all interest at a rate of 3 %, which was incorrect because a portion of the interest was at 2 % and another portion was to be at 3 % according to the terms of the HAMP modification. Additionally, your employee XXXX signed off on the affidavit asserting he had reviewed the account and the amounts calculated were factual. This is a violation of FDCPA 15 U.S.C, 1692e ( 2 ), UNFAIR PRACTICES, "" the false representation of the character, amount or legal status of any debt '' and FDCPA 15 USC 1692f ( 1 ) "" The collection of any amount ( including any interest, fee, charge, or expense incidental to the principal obligation ) unless such amount is expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law '' 9. What date did BOA file and pay the required mortgage mediation fee? 
10. What exactly is BOA doing to expedite the foreclosure? Please provide detail, dates, etc.

2017-04-13	Consumer Loan	Installment loan	Taking out the loan or lease		"I have had a 10+ year realationship with WELLS FARGO. I also in the past have taken out Unsecured Personal Loans and had no issue with approval. Actually, the last time I applied I was approved in under 20 minutes. 

This time however, I put my roommate on the loan who has bad credit. I was told that the leading applicant who makes the most money ( me ) would be the primary on the loan and that there should be no problem in applying. 

They declined my loan because my co applicant has bad credit. HOWEVER, I was told that he should not have an effect on this loan other than being able to build credit by being a co applicant. 

My issue is this- How the XXXX can I apply for a loan and no one calls me to follow up and tell me WHY I got declined. Provide me with NO NUMBER to call in and find out more information. No link to see reasons of a decline. Nothing but a pointless hit on my credit and my co applicants, who clearly has bad credit so why not hurt it more by applying. 

Wells Fargo is nothing but a bunch of rich XXXX who give XXXX wages to their emplyoees and rip people off. How is a RELATIONSHIP lender not going to loan me money at the MINIMUM amount when I have over 9k+ in savings and a credit score over XXXX. 

They need to be fined for more than chump change. They need to change their processes. If you really are the CFPB DO something rather than give a tiny fine and then take the money to your own pockets.

Appointment made through XXXX system and Appraiser # 1 came to our home and completed an appraisal in the amount of $ XXXX. XXXX, Wells Fargo Mortgage Company rejected this appraisal indicated there was "" Undo Influence '' We asked WF for explanation and was told the "" under writing department '' made this determination and would not be allowed to share this information. 
WF ' Mortgage Loan Officer said a 2nd appraisal will be ordered at their cost and all locks and extensions would be paid for by WF. 
Appraisal # 2 ordered and Appraiser # 2 came to our home and completed appraisal XX/XX/XXXX for a value of $ XXXX. WF rejected the 2nd appraisal and asks Appraiser # 2 to change items in the appraisal. Once Appraiser # 2 changed his value and a reviewer paid for by WF came by our home and reviewed the changed appraisal, he reported back to XXXX that this appraisal was approved and nothing found wrong. The changed value was changed by appraiser # 2 from $ XXXX to $ XXXX I spoke with Appraiser # 1 on XX/XX/XXXX and asked him if he had filed a complaint. His answer was NO, if there was any undo influence he would have not completed the appraisal and was not subjected to any undo influence. 
We spoke with the reviewer on XX/XX/XXXX and he reviewed the appraisal of $ XXXX and not the one for $ XXXX. He also indicated that he left the value blank but confirmed the content of the appraisal he was reviewing. 
We have a letter from Appraiser # 2 written to Wells Fargo who clearly points out in capital letters the following "" I HAVE REVIEWED YOUR REQUEST AND QUESTIONS, I HAVE MADE THE ADJUSTMENTS WHERE NECESSARY AND THE MARKET VALUE HAS CHANGED, THANK YOU FOR ASSISTING ME ''. 
We want the following communications from Wells Fargo Mortgage and XXXX. 1. We want to know the questions and what assistance was giving to Appraiser # 2. 
2. Who made the determination that the appraisal # 1 was rejected and why 3. Want all communications between XXXX and Wells Fargo Mortgage. 
4. All communications from the executive level complaint department regarding their process for determining the value of my home and why my request was rejected for $ XXXX. All of our communications were recorded and we would like a transcript of all communications. 
The outcome cost me out of pocket expenses of over $ 20K in principle and interest payments. Additionally, the Mortgage Loan officer asked me to pay down my mortgage balance with a payment of $ XXXX before the 1st appraisal was rejected. I agreed and did but the 2nd appraisal came in at $ XXXX. I asked for the original loan amount from the first appraisal of $ XXXX and it was rejected. XXXX had determine that value for this loan would be $ XXXX and I appealed to their executive level complaint department working with a lady from XXXX who would not share any information with me regarding Under Writing Departments rejection of my appeal for the value to be $ XXXX and or why. 
I was told from the executive level complaint department that the last lock and extension would be XX/XX/XXXX. So were forced to accept the value of $ XXXX or lose our locked in interest rate and WF would not pay for anymore extension in order to resolved this matter of value of our home and rejected the idea that WF had influence on the value of our home, so we signed and settled the refinance of our home on XX/XX/XXXX for the value of our house being $ XXXX. I think that this process was flawed by WF and Core Logic and we think this action should be reported to the proper agency to determine the action of WF and XXXX working together instead of independent of each other who clearly influence the appraiser # 2 and in his own words, changed the market value of our home with assistance from WF."

I have disputed this balance several times now with TransUnion because the original creditor will not comply with requests for itemized and detailed invoices and line item charges which I have requested multiple times from collection agency who now has this account. My purpose in requesting these was to instigate an affidavit of unauthorized charges on this original account. I get nowhere with collection agency and in fact am told that they are only required to provide basic and satisfying information to validate the debt to the reporting credit bureau. I know it is my account, however, the question is accuracy of amount due because of these unauthorized charges. My complaint with original creditor is that these unauthorized charges are the result of retailer ( in this case XXXX revolving card ) not verifying my identity with proper ID at time of purchase therefore allowing unauthorized person ( s ) to charge to my account. Twice in XX/XX/XXXX, attempts were made with representative XXXX at collection agency ( XXXX XXXX ) but told each time that his agency has sent required docs to reporting agencies. I requested to haves them sent to me as well and was told that I should get them in 7-10 days. I had even sent, via mail, a request for documents and NOT EVEN a response back. Nothing! 
At this time, this is neither here nor there now as I have moved past trying to get the collection agency to provide my requests and now see that my time is wasted dealing with the collection agency as I was getting nowhere. Therefore, I directed my complaint to TransUnion in the hope that their investigation would prompt collection agency to provide accurate account information. 
TransUnion has a responsibility in proper investigating and in reporting to me the timely status of the investigation instead of the dry and customary "" meets FCRA requirements ''. I have disputed this twice now ( three if you count the initial phone call dispute ) with TransUnion and do n't even get the courtesy of a letter or email to notify me of status or findings. I am very frustrated and feel as though I have no rights in this matter and have gotten nowhere in following recommended protocol and steps for resolution. This has been an education for me and I have learned that the reporting bureaus do n't have to substantiate anything except known public record type of information to satisfy the proof of debt. The credit process has been made to be a black or white issue with reporting and follows a general set of guidelines and protocol therefore making it a laborious process to communicate situations and disputes that are not always black or white and do require more ethical investigation than just the standardized proof of debt validation. On top of this, it has easy to see the close relationship that the bureaus keep with the lenders and creditors that works against the borrower in many cases when a person such as myself has to fight for my right to obtain information and request dispute resolutions. 

For final disposition on this matter, I request that this be removed from my report with TransUnion as I see no other viable or satisfying solution and have exhausted all resources."

The new reporting is particularly a problem due to the fact that I disputed the older one through the bureau in XX/XX/2016 and then this new one pops up on my report as well, even though they presumably had means/info to contact me especially about any new debt to come up after a dispute for an old one, but failed to do so. The first I 'm hearing of this is when I see it on my credit report. I do not know what it is, nor has it been validated for me nor have I been given the chance to request validation. If they would have contacted me the right way, they would have been paid, thus keeping it off my credit report. The CR says open date of XX/XX/2016 and report date of XX/XX/2016, so when between that time have they bothered to contact me? Seems like they just started reporting quickly in hopes that I would discover it and be shocked into paying it versus going about it the right way.

I explained that this must be a mistake on their part because I do not go to XXXX and have not used my Paypal account for a really long time. They were unable to provide a phone number or a signature associated with this charge but offered to check to see if it was fraudulent charge. I received a letter a few days after that, saying the did not detect any fraud in this case. Again this month I received a bill from Paypal this time for additional charges of {$35.00} late fee and {$2.00} interest charge. I have looked up my account through the Paypal website because I was considering reporting the incident elsewhere, to see if I could find any information about the transaction myself. The website stated no transactions have been made to my account in over a year! I was unable to print a copy of this with the name of the website visible or I would have sent this in. Since Paypal continues to bill me for a charge a did not make, I would like some intervention by the CFPB in this matter. I am also sending copies of the bills and the letter I received from paypal.

XXXX, I sent another letter, again requesting complete validation of the account under FDCPA XXXX MCM/Midland responded with a duplicate of their previous letter without any supporting documents to their claim. So, TWICE they neglected to send me documentation validating this debt they claim I owe. 
XXXX I sent a letter via certified mail to cease communication with me under the FDCPA and Florida statute XXXX, unless they were notifying me that the matter is closed. They did not respond to this letter. 
On XXXX they illegally reported this un-validated collection account on my credit reports and illegally RE-AGED this supposed debt to XXXX XXXX, 2016, with an increased balance to {$12000.00}. 
XXXX I called XXXX to dispute the collection. "" XXXX '' with XXXX refused to request written validation from Midland and refused to remove the collection from my report until it is properly validated with real documents and not just on Midland 's electronic confirmation. When I told him I would have to report this refusal to the FTC, he began to speak abusively and derisively to me, and also refused to give me his real name so that I could properly document the phone call. 
It is seriously damaging my credit in the meantime. I am still in the process of calling to dispute Midland 's collection account with with XXXX and XXXX."		ENCORE CAPITAL GROUP INC.	FL	321XX	Servicemember	Consent provided	Web	2017-03-06	Closed with explanation	True	No	2372618

2017-03-25	Credit reporting		Credit reporting company's investigation	No notice of investigation status/result	"I have disputed the issue with the reporting company but have not received a final response other than what shows on my credit tracking apps. 
I could argue that several of the reasoning options listed above would suffice as a grounds for complaint, ie., did not get proper help over the phone, problem with statement of dispute, investigation took too long, etc. ... .and, I could probably add a few more not listed. I am frustrated! 
My complaint is against TransUnion for not addressing my dispute with original creditor ( collection agency ) with proper ethics and advocacy on my part. I have disputed this balance several times now with TransUnion because the original creditor will not comply with requests for itemized and detailed invoices and line item charges which I have requested multiple times from collection agency who now has this account. My purpose in requesting these was to instigate an affidavit of unauthorized charges on this original account. I get nowhere with collection agency and in fact am told that they are only required to provide basic and satisfying information to validate the debt to the reporting credit bureau. I know it is my account, however, the question is accuracy of amount due because of these unauthorized charges. My complaint with original creditor is that these unauthorized charges are the result of retailer ( in this case XXXX XXXX ) not verifying my identity with proper ID at time of purchase therefore allowing unauthorized person ( s ) to charge to my account. Twice, attempts were made with representative XXXX XXXX at collection agency ( The Bureaus ) but told each time that his agency does not get those documents from the original creditor and therefore can not and is not required to supply them to me or to the reporting credit bureaus. I had even sent, via mail, a request for documents and NOT EVEN a response back. 
At this time, this is neither here nor there now as I have moved past trying to get the collection agency to provide my requests and now see that my time is wasted dealing with the collection agency as I was getting nowhere. Therefore, I directed my complaint to TransUnion in the hope that their investigation would prompt collection agency to provide accurate account information. 
TransUnion has a responsibility in proper investigating and in reporting to me the timely status of the investigation instead of the dry and customary "" meets FCRA requirements ''. I have disputed this twice now ( three if you count the initial phone call dispute ) with TransUnion and do n't even get the courtesy of a letter or email to notify me of status or findings. I am very frustrated and feel as though I have no rights in this matter and have gotten nowhere in following recommended protocol and steps for resolution. This has been an education for me and I have learned that the reporting bureaus do n't have to substantiate anything except known public record type of information to satisfy the proof of debt. The credit process has been made to be a black or white issue with reporting and follows a general set of guidelines and protocol therefore making it a laborious process to communicate situations and disputes that are not always black or white and do require more ethical investigation than just the standardized proof of debt validation. On top of this, it has easy to see the close relationship that the bureaus keep with the lenders and creditors that works against the borrower in many cases when a person such as myself has to fight for my right to obtain information and request dispute resolutions. 
For final disposition on this matter, I request that this be removed from my report with TransUnion as I see no other viable or satisfying solution and have exhausted all resources."

2017-03-06	Credit card		Unsolicited issuance of credit card		"I received a call ( phone message ) from Chase 's fraud unit informing me that someone had applied for a Chase XXXX credit card and that I should call to verify. I became concerned, because I HAD N'T APPLIED for any such card. 
I called my credit protection service, XXXX and they advised me to put a fraud alert on my account, which I did. 
When I called Chase back, they told me that they had ISSUED the credit card. I was livid to think that they would proceed WITHOUT my confirmation. They did not apologize, except to cancel the card. Nor did they agree to file my complaint about their system to their corporate headquarters. I DO NOT have any connection to Chase ... no bank account, no credit or debit card, no loan. 
Since then I received a letter from XXXX informing me that the credit alert was registered and also that I was entitled to a copy of the fraudulent application details. So I called Chase and they informed me that I had to send a written request to them with all kinds of documentation, including police reports etc. 
I can not comprehend WHY I need to supply this information WHEN it was CHASE who initiated the inquiry and therefore I do not have any documentation except what I 've received from them. A letter, which I attached arrived a few days after their phone call message. 
This aspect of fraud protection is NOT adequate and obviously Chase is inept and negligent in protecting its customers. 
I am grateful for your willingness to establish accountability for corporate policy and look forward to your reply."		JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.	OR	972XX	Older American	Consent provided	Web	2017-03-06	Closed with explanation	True	Yes	2374362

I accepted the fact that I had only the option of the short sale. In XX/XX/2016 the house was placed on the market as a short sale. The house had a offer within two weeks of being placed on the market. I contacted Chase to see if I qualified for the HAFA/Relocation assistance. The Chase representative looked into my account and told me I was eligible for the HAFA assistance at the full amount of {$10000.00}. My realtor has been very timely in sending Chase all documents needed for the short sale. Since the offer has been submitted in XX/XX/2016 Chase has been dragging their feet in this process. Now the HAFA/relocation program has expired XX/XX/2016 and Chase is telling me I no longer qualify for relocation assistance, even when my home was listed and going through the process prior to the XX/XX/2016 expiration date. I feel my account and loan should still be honored for the relocation assistance. I 'm making sure the property is being taken care of and has not been abandoned through this process and feel Chase should grant me the relocation assistance that I originally qualified for.

2017-04-16	Credit card		APR or interest rate		"In XX/XX/2013 my wife and I went to the local Wells Fargo bank to open a checking account after moving back into the area.After going thru the registration process with the checking acc., the young lady representing the bank mentioned their crediet card set up and its benefits, one of which was overdraft protection and a 0 % promotion rate. We agreed to add that on mainly for the overdraft protection. As i mentioned we had moved back to the area after purchasing my parents home. this was done 3 months prior to the Wells Fargo bank visit.It should be noted that we purchased the home with a 15 yr. fixed mortgage at 2.62 %. My wife handles all the bill paying online. About 5 months after initial checking sign up, my wife developed health issues ( on XXXX now ) and our focus was somewhat divided. It was not till the following XXXX that I opened a billing from Wells Fargo and noticed that we were being charged 26 % interest on our credit card. My credit score during this time span has been in the XXXX-XXXX range.Over the last cpl. yrs I have contacted numerous departments, talked to different levels of employee ranks and have never been able to get a clear or definitive answer as to why a rate that high was applied to our account.I have asked what criteria was used to determine rate, again no clear cut responce. I also have another credit card ( XXXX XXXX ) with a rate half the Wells Fargo rate.After reading all the articles over the last 6-9 months regarding Wells Fargo banks practices I decided to file this complaint to hopefully get some action on this matter. 

Thank You, XXXX P.S. I have asked them to lower the rate to the level it should be each time without any results"	Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response	WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION	PA	187XX		Consent provided	Web	2017-04-16	Closed with explanation	False	No	2437132

( This was my first time ever posting anything to sale on XXXX ) At XXXX the same day, I received a text notification to my cell phone from an individual who claimed the name XXXX XXXX from Indiana, who said she was interested in my sales ad to purchase the vehicle. She texted that she could not talk over the phone due to XXXX of being XXXX. So we communicated concerning the vehicle via text. She agreed to purchase the vehicle as the said price of XXXX by way of XXXX deposit. However, at the time of purchase, she sent me multiple emails on behalf of XXXX, that for security purposes between the buyer and seller, that I had to pay XXXX upfront to cover the fees for car pick up, shipping, and delivery, which she claimed was included in what she transferred to XXXX ( total of XXXX ). The assumed claimed agent over the account was XXXX XXXX. After transferring the funds through Walmart2Walmart money transfer, no funds were officially sent to my account and she took the {$1300.00}. In addition, she asked for another {$920.00} to cover insurance costs in having the vehicle sent. The entire situation was very frustration and deceiving. I was totally thrown off by this and really want justice from this. I have saved every email received and receipts.

2017-04-11	Bank account or service	Checking account	Deposits and withdrawals		Bank of American violated Federal rules when they placed a 10 day hold on a ATM deposit of Cashiers check {$4600.00} that I had drawn from my XXXX locally down the street. After calling them multiple times and visiting the branch 3 times on my trip out of state. They decided they can just do what they please even after I pointed out to employees and supervisors that they were violating FDIC rules on clearing bank deposits. Their actions caused me to be late with my mortgage payment which I transfer every month through the branch. The hold did not qualify under the exception rules at all and they were told that and still kept the hold in place long after the cashiers check cleared. I want some sort of sanctions or formal reprimand placed against B of A for not following the rules and I should be given both an apology and some sort of monetary compensation for damaging my payment record with my lender and causing me to drive 3 hours 3 times out of state to the nearest B of A while I was on vacation to try to handle the problem. I had to pull out over {$4000.00} more from another bank causing me extra fees and charges just to make my mortgage payment which was late because of their hold.

The response from Wellsfargo did not address the complaint. The issue here is that Wellsfargo steals my money of {$1700.00} and using fake excuses to cover up. 
I am the one who opened the checking account. I did come to XXXX branch to see banker named XXXX and showed her my driver license to prove my identity. 
As per XXXX at Wellsfargo Identity Theft Operation ( XXXX ), there is no identity theft claim. I have tried to call and left several messages @ XXXX but no one ever calls me back. Wellsfargo created this whole fiasco to steal my earnest money. 
I still have {$1700.00} in my account. I want the money to be refunded to me. The issue here is Wellsfargo does not want me to have access to my money or return the money to me. 
I do not raise any concern about identity theft with Wellsfargo. I did check my credit report and did not see anything new. Wellsfargo made up the whole story. First, I was told someone tried to use my profile to open the credit card. Later, I was asked to come to the branch to prove my identity. Now, Wellsfargo said the account was opened without proper authorization while I am indeed the one to open the checking account. I demand Wellsfargo to refund my money ASAP. Thanks."

2017-01-30	Consumer Loan	Vehicle lease	Taking out the loan or lease		"XX/XX/XXXX RE : illegal Business Practices at Infinity-Nissan Infinity Acct # XXXX I have a lease contract for 24 months with Infinity Financial for a vehicle that started XX/XX/XXXX and will end XX/XX/XXXX. All monthly payment has been made. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I became aware that infinity was tell us that they are missing A payment. Since XX/XX/XXXX. And that all the payments we were making was Being posted as late. On the phone, we agreed to make a payment including late Charges for {$400.00} and we agreed that I would send the payment to them. 
We send the payment to Infinity the same day. ( copy attached ) Also, they advise us that they are missing the XX/XX/XXXX Payment. We faxed them our bank statement showing that in fact a payment for {$300.00} was made on XX/XX/XXXX. 
See copy attached and Letter from Bank. It is very strange that if we are missing a payment, they would call us so late on this even after they were reporting us as being late for every month. 

On XXXX unknow to us Infinity illegally repossessed the vehicle, this is less Then 30 days that we are to return the Lease vehicle. ( how buzzer is that ). 

This is a Clear tactic infinity is using to negligently forced sell the vehicle to us. At this point I have requested over three times to get my payment history with them but they Keep stalling, signaling that there is something they wish to hide. 

We are proving clearly that Infinity has received all the payment required on a lease And we have called talked to them several times but they do not wish to admit that they Made a mistake and keep telling us that its over. "" We will sell the car at Auction prices and bill you the Balance '' This is not our agreement, we do not wish to purchase the vehicle. This is Clear to me that infinity financial has a vested interest in trying to force sell this vehicle To me a Retail prices. A classic example of a big Bully. 

If infinity Financial tries to unfairly pursue this illegal activity. I have no choice but to take Legal action. This is a demand that infinity return the vehicle from where they picked it up from And let the course of our agreement run out on XX/XX/XXXX."

2017-04-07	Credit card		Other fee		I applied and was approved for a Barclay Gold Card in XX/XX/XXXX because of the very generous benefits they offered XXXX Military ie waived {$990.00} annual fee, 0 % APR, etc. Shortly after the holidays, earlier this year, I was notified that Barclays was no longer going to honor waiving the {$990.00} fee and if my account wasnt closed prior to XX/XX/XXXX, I would be assessed that fee. I feel as if Barclays baited me into a great deal and then pulled the rug out as soon as i was approved and began using the card racking up a balance over the holidays. I now have a balance on a card that i need to close within the next 6 months or else i will incur a {$990.00} fee that I am not prepared to pay. I would never have applied for this CC if i knew i would have to pay a {$990.00} fee.

I sought a short sale of the Property, given the debt was seriously under the market value. Chase Bank promised through its authorized agents multiple times that a short sale was approved, only to have ultimate closings rejected by Chase. I relied in good faith on such representations to my detriment. I could have taken other actions to mitigate my losses if I had not relied in good faith on Chase 's misrepresentations. I further relied on promises of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. It has been 4 years and no resolution from Chase. Just recently I was informed my identity was stolen. Someone was representing themselves as me through XXXX and attempting to take rental funds. All of this could have been avoided but for Chase 's negligent and fraudulent misrepresentation.

2017-03-06	Student loan	Non-federal student loan	Dealing with my lender or servicer	Trouble with how payments are handled	I was encouraged to defer my payment for three months by Navient. I told every financial counselor I spoke with from Navient that I was unemployed and looking for a job and that I could not afford payments. They told me I could take a deferment for three months once my account was up to date. I asked my Mom to help me make that payment and after the payment was received they told me I was unable to take a deferment. I received countless calls every day ( 3 or more times daily, at all hours of the day ) from navient financial counselors. Several months later I found out I was in a deferment for three months, and I asked why I was still receiving harrassing calls from navient workers. All the counselor I was speaking with did was apologize. I still am not employed full time, I work part time and it is difficult for me to make my payments every month ( although I do, about 50 % + of my income is paid to student loans ). I told navient counselors this and asked for information on other payment plans. I began asking this in XXXX and was told an email would be sent out to my mother ( these loans are in her name ) and that they would sent mail about repayment plans to our house. Nothing was sent and I have been asking them every month since XXXX about this. I am disgusted with dealing with Navient/ XXXX XXXX and I hope these circumstances change for the people who are indebted by them. If my payments were lower I could afford to do a lot more, but with the circumstance I am in now, I would have to make at least double what I make now to ever be able to move out and live on my own.

2017-03-06	Debt collection	Mortgage	False statements or representation	Indicated shouldn't respond to lawsuit	"I have a mortgage that is being serviced by Nationstar Mortgage. I tendered my deed in lieu of foreclosure back in XX/XX/XXXX and was told to move out of my house by XX/XX/XXXX. Shortly before the XX/XX/XXXX date I was informed by my contact person there that there was a problem with a "" power of attorney '' that was delaying the closing of the transfer. After more inquiry I learned that Nationstar alleged that they did not have all the documents necessary to have an interest in the property since XXXX, the former servicer of the debt, had not sent in all the proper paperwork in XX/XX/XXXX or so. This "" delay '' has continued since. I was informed via letter received XXXX ( although dated XX/XX/XXXX ) that matters would proceed to a closing in early XX/XX/XXXX. I again hustled to move the remainder of my items out of my old house to meet the deadline when I was informed by another letter that things had been pushed back to XX/XX/XXXX, then subsequent identical letters to XX/XX/XXXX and then XX/XX/XXXX. I made contact with XXXX in the Fall of XX/XX/XXXX and they informed me that they had completed all the paperwork and there was no problem from their end. I examined the chain of title to my property, and I found that Nationstar did not have a recorded interest in the property from XXXX to them. They did have a recorded transfer from Nationstar to XXXX in the Fall of XX/XX/XXXX. Coincidentally, XXXX filed their transfer from a prior servicer, XXXX, in the XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX, but the actual transfer took place in XX/XX/XXXX. I am upset that I have been paying Nationstar since XX/XX/XXXX and they do not have any proveable interest in my mortgage, and still do not have XXXX to this day. They apparently transferred whatever interest away in XX/XX/XXXX, but have failed to disclose that to me. Consequently due to the delay I have incurred multiple moving bills, had to maintain utilities on XXXX locations, and lost my original house that I was moving to to an arson fire because I could not move in to secure it. My phone contact person at Nationstar told me that the original letters indicating the need to vacate by XXXX and then XXXX were not sent from her office, but by another Department at Nationstar. Incidentally, I was on the verge of filing to participate in the national settlement that XXXX had entered into about these mortgage loans when they abruptly informed me that they transferred my servicing to Nationstar."

2017-03-01	Mortgage	FHA mortgage	Loan modification,collection,foreclosure		"Carrington Mortgage provided me a response but i do not believe they were completely honest. Please see my response that includes the reason I believe they are out of compliance based on their response. Also I was in the mortgage industry for over 20 years. At XXXX Lenders made sure they did everything to try to help the borrower saved their home because if XXXX felt the lender did not follow a process to help home owners they were subject to have to buy that loan. FHA/HUD should establish a policy that put more responsibility on the lender. Because the lender will do minimum because they know they will be reimbursed by FHA MIP. Please see below. 
XX/XX/2017 XXXX XXXX XXXX, VA XXXX Phone # XXXX To : Consumer Financial Protection Bureau I recently filed a complaint against Carrington Mortgage because I felt they was out of compliance to assist me with avoiding Foreclosure as a home owner in XXXX. They responded in which they claimed they contacted me several times to help me ; however it was only 3 times in which they called my cell phone ( XXXX ) and my phone tracks all calls to my number based on an application that tracks calls. However, the main reason they are out of compliance is because they never contacted my wife. I previously called Carrington Mortgage and gave them my wife 's phone number and address because she moved out of the house. Carrington Mortgage had a responsibility to contact my wife directly and request the signed application and her income documents. However, they was setting my loan up for foreclosure my not making an effort to try to help me as an homeowner. 
I was in the mortgage business for over 20 years prior to becoming XXXX. I worked 15 years with XXXX of the top mortgage lenders and I ended my career with XXXX prior to becoming XXXX during XXXX to remove a XXXX. Although we are both on the mortgage because we are separated the lender is suppose to us separately contact my wife for any documents they need. This compliance requirement would actually help me as the homeowner because if I have to go to court for a judge to require my wife to sign a quit claim deed or sign the application and provide her income. We would all benefit, lenders like Carrington that does the minimum effort to claim they are following guidelines do n't care about the home owner because they will be reimbursed by FHA. In my case I also need an exception in which the lender could grant me and underwrite my loan based on my income or they would consider me for a workout option and make the signing of the application and income documents of my wife conditional. As a home owner my wife does not care about me loosing my home with XXXX children that is the reason she abandon us. She is also on SSD and knows her income can not be garnished. 
Please help me. Please ask Carrington Mortgage to assist with my workout options by submitting my loan for a workout option. I am trying my best to keep my XXXX children and I form having to move from our home because of a divorce in which my wife only cares about herself. Making the workout option documents conditional in which I have provided all my documents requested ; will still meets HUD 's guideline based on my situation it would allow me to remain in my home. They could also allow me to make XXXX payments to give me time in case I need to take my wife to court.

I will ask the court to refer to the previous lawsuit and see that the business practices have no changed of the company and they are n't following the criteria set forth for them.

2. FedLoan is falsely reporting I was in forbearance for times when payments were made. I would not make payments during forbearance ( i.e. that is what forbearance requests is for ... inability to make payments ). 
3.

Then, FedLoan Servicing enrolled me on "" graduated payments '' fully knowing this plan will not make any payment eligible for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. 
4. Not explaining the information unless asked directly leaves the consumer to "" have to '' be able to ask the right questions - which we obviously do n't know, in order to receive assistance - this is misleading and deceptive.

2017-03-06	Student loan	Federal student loan servicing	Can't repay my loan	Can't decrease my monthly payments	The federal student loan interest rate is too high for borrowers, which does not provide incentive for Americans to pursue a higher education or enable them to save for their future. Moreover, if a borrower consolidates their federal loans, the interest rate becomes fixed for the life of the loan, locking in the borrower for years of repayment with high interest. This discourages Americans from pursuing higher education opportunities and does not enable borrowers to pay back loans in a reasonable time frame. High interest rates do not allow Americans to pay back their loans in time to save for their future through investing in a home, retirement or saving for their children 's education.

I was on the income driven plan that paid {$230.00} in interest only payments. The only reason they made a deal with me was because I was late on a payment or two. I tried calling previously and said they would n't be able to do anything for me because I could pay the {$500.00} a month payment. In order for me to get a lower payment, they extended my loan term to 40 years. There is no way I will be able ever pay off my student loans. It 's cheaper for me to stay in school at least part time than it is for me to repay my student loans.		Navient Solutions, LLC.

I have had the same cel phone number since XX/XX/XXXX. I have added lines since then for my family and business. I have always paid the bill, never had the service cut and have always worked through issues or discrepancies with the company. Somehow, XXXX claims there is a XXXX balance from several years ago. Keep in mind my monthly cel phone bill averages over {$500.00} a month. I called XXXX and disputed the charge. I was under the impression that the matter was resolved and that it was an accounting error or misapplication when the account was reassigned to a new representative and switched to a business account. At some point I was contacted by a collection agencies and explained this and the matter was not reported to my credit report. I disputed and assumed my dispute was communicated back to XXXX who verified my position and I never heard back from that agency. Then several months later I was contacted by Diversified with the same claim. I disputed it. Then they reported it as in collections. I contacted Diversified and they said they verified the debt with XXXX. They never presented documentation that I owe this or that XXXX did in fact verify something that I had understood to be resolved in my favor. Now this mark is listed as in collection and is impacting my otherwise very good credit score.		Diversified Consultants, Inc.

2017-03-06	Consumer Loan	Vehicle loan	Managing the loan or lease		My Toyota financial payments are made through EFT transaction. On XX/XX/2017 XXXX deducted the wrong amount from my bank account. My correct payment amount is {$380.00}, but Toyota deducted {$310.00} which is an incorrect amount. I was not aware of this until my credit monitoring service notified me on XX/XX/2017 that I had a derogatory mark on my credit report. After investigating I learned that Toyota Financial had reported my XX/XX/XXXX payment 30 days late. After checking my bank statements for the prior three months I noticed that the XX/XX/2017 payment amount that was deducted from my account was not the correct amount. I logged onto my Toyota Financial account and saw that I had an outstanding balance of {$63.00} and a late charge of {$3.00}. Next, I called Toyota Financial and spoke to a customer service representative. I explained what happened as best as I could, but the CSR had a heavy accent. I could not understand her well and she could not understand me - she repeatedly asked me the same questions over and over and could not understand my answers. In the end she told me there was nothing she could do and that I would have to dispute the matter with the XXXX credit reporting agencies. This error on Toyota 's part has cost me XXXX points on my credit score. That 's exactly how much lower my score is now. I spent several hours on the phone this morning with the XXXX credit reporting agencies : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. XXXX told me they would remove the error immediately. XXXX told me they would file a complaint against Toyota Financial and review the dispute and rule on it within 30 days. XXXX and XXXX told me they would review the dispute and rule on it within 30 days. This error has caused an undue amount of hardship. I want Toyota Financial to correct my credit report with all of the agencies they report to and refund the late charge to me.

Since my loans shifted from XXXX and XXXX over to Navient I have had nothing but misinformation.

Yet, the first XXXX are showing under the details in forbearance until XX/XX/XXXX, if they 're in forbearance how is a payment due this XX/XX/XXXX??? The other XXXX are showing in forbearance until XXXX, again how is a payment due XXXX if forbearance does n't end until XX/XX/XXXX ( which, again is not even the date I requested )?! I am thoroughly confused by this information, and I feel it is intentional to mislead. I have tried contacting Navient concerning this and they ca n't give me a straight answer.

2017-03-02	Credit reporting		Credit reporting company's investigation	No notice of investigation status/result	In accordance to FCRA Section 609, these accounts was further disputed in XX/XX/2017. And Portfolio Recovery did not respond to the initial dispute within 30 days as allowed by the FCRA. They have continued to report inaccurate information and these XXXX accounts to two credit bureaus. In accordance, they are bound by FCRA to remove alleged debt from that is being reported. It is now XX/XX/2017 and past 60 days when these accounts were initially disputed. And Portfolio Recovery has continued to attempt to collect debt that they know is not valid and not able to be verified. Multiple disputes in regards to this issue have been filed over this, including a previous dispute with CFPB. In addition, Portfolio Recovery has not removed the XXXX accounts in question from my XXXX reports and XXXX reports. They have blatantly broken the law as they relate to FDCPA and FCRA guidelines. On more than one occasion, I have tried to resolve this issue with them but they are refusing to follow the law in regards to this issue. The accounts need to be removed. They also stated that documentation was mailed to me which is false. Nothing since they placed these accounts on my reports has been mailed to me. The second issue is that it had been has been proven that the accounts are not valid, no information was provided to verify this account. They state that they are about professionalism but it is obvious that they are not. They have been deceitful, dishonest, and unprofessional in the manner that they have handled this issue from day one. I feel that the only course of action is to file a civil suit which my attorneys have drafted up and will present with my signed petition on XX/XX/2017. I am tired of dealing with this company and this issue. I will also be filing a complaint with the Attorney General as it is within my rights. They have made this process long and hard. I also have proof that I reached out to them with certified letters to them and the credit reporting agencies. Also they could not verify definitively that the accounts are mine and that they belonged on my credit. If they were sure they belonged to me, why are they not responding to my correspondence or supplying me something with my signature. This is what I mean by dishonest and unprofesisonal business ethics and practices. They have cost me money in this process of disputing with them and this is getting out of hand. They stated that they have a right to collect but they indeed DO NOT by rights and provisions provided to consumers under FDCPA and FCRA. This harassment and blatant disregard for the law is what is have me want to seek damages from Portfolio Recovery with filing legal suit against them.

2017-03-06	Credit card		Credit card protection / Debt protection		On XX/XX/2016, my husband drove my son 's XXXX to XXXX in XXXX, NC. I followed him so we could leave the car there. After receiving a call from XXXX, the owner, that the car was ready, we went there, paid the bill, and left. Over the next few days, the car began to run nearly as bad as it did when we initially dropped it off. My husband and I went to XXXX to ask XXXX XXXX about the repairs. This is when the problems began. We agree the radiator repairs were completed satisfactory, but there have been consistent issues with how poorly the car runs. Since our initial claim with XXXX and Chase, we have consistently been denied any form of resolution. Chase finally indicated we needed a third party appraisal. My husband contacted XXXX other repair facilities, but after receiving Chase 's final denial letter, my husband called the XXXX repair facilities and no one indicated that Chase had made any form of inquiry. My husband requested that Chase provide us with written documentation explaining their findings as to why they denied my claim. My husband finally spoke with XXXX, a female at Chase. She denied any additional information and stated that since I had received the final denial letter, she would not discuss the issue any further and refused to provide any verbal communication or written documentation explaining their findings as to why they denied my claim. I have provided additional documentation with this claim. Chase has provided no help to me, the consumer, but had rather defend the business rather than their customer. Additionally, XXXX claimed we had not contacted him about this issue after the initial repair and he also told this to Chase. I have included a copy of the XXXX 's certified receipt where my certified letter to XXXX was received.		JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

2016-09-15	Debt collection	I do not know	Disclosure verification of debt	Not given enough info to verify debt	"ISSUE : ALSO FALSE STATEMENT OR REPRESENTATION I received a letter from a debt buyer, Pendrick Capital Partners II, LLC, for an old debt that was never verified and/or validated from the previous debt buyer. One problem is that the old debt buyer that just sold it, XXXX, did so I believe out of spite and because they obtained recent info on me from a recent complaint filed against them and they have since decided to send that info on to a 3rd ( or 4th ) party to attempt to collect this old debt and/or to purposely have it end up on my credit report since they now have to remove a different account reporting as a result of the complaint filed against them ( diff acct. ). The second problem is the debt buyer they sold to, Pendrick Capital Partners, LLC sent me a letter ( attached ) where they boldly and falsely claim to have purchased this debt from the Original Creditor which is an outright lie. This is where I should mention that this same account is still currently being reported on my credit report by XXXX who, per my knowledge and per current CB reports, is the current owner of this account. I have not been made aware of any transfer or sell of this debt other than Pendrick sending me this letter claiming to be the owner of the account. Nor has XXXX stopped reporting on the account, closed it or removed it from the bureaus. Also, note the letter does not state "" new '' owner and lists a different name and address for where to send the payment to, a different address/state for the return address and a different name as the Current Creditor. So, who owns the account? Who is the rightful and legal Creditor? This is all very misleading and is obviously a bunch of false representation. This could very well be the same debt buyer, XXXX, that is currently reporting this debt to CB just using unethical tactics and playing games. I have checked and can not locate any registration in Indiana or Michigan for Pendrick Capital, XXXX or any of the names they have listed. And because I know how XXXX, who either sold the debt or NOT, operates, I am taking a proactive approach since I feel like this is being done purposely to either end up being reported and more than likely double-reported on my credit reports or to XXXX me into paying a debt that was never even validated by XXXX. Or both. Because I 'd like to avoid BOTH of these things from happening, and because I 've never had this debt validated or the opportunity to validate and because I personally have never done any business with XXXX, Pendrick, XXXX, etc., I am asking for Pendrick Capital Partners II LLC, XXXX, XXXX, etc. to provide the following : 1. Full original Account Number 2. Date original Account was opened 3. Any written agreements between myself and the original creditor stating this debt is owed 4. Full account summary and itemized calculation of alleged debt or services 5. Date of the first delinquency. 6. Verification- # from the Secretary of State that they are registered in IN or MI, or whatever state they claim to be registered in/with. 7. Full name of the actual and legal debt owner. 8. Whether they purchased the debt, who it was bought from, when, and amount. XXXX. The name and address of the bonding agent for your collection agency.

Borrowers who are single have similar, if not more, financial burden than those with a family size of two or more. Permitting borrowers who are single to recalculate their student loan payments will decrease their short-term financial burden, and although may take them longer to pay off the loans, will put them in a better financial situation long-term to be able to save for their future.

2017-03-06	Mortgage	Conventional fixed mortgage	Application, originator, mortgage broker		"I first contacted Quicken loans in XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to XXXX XXXX. During that conversation, he suggested that he would be able to get our monthly payment down to around {$1100.00}. This estimate was given based on our current monthly payment, loan amount, escrow with insurance, and additional information. When I asked if that included taxes and insurance, he said yes. In a follow up conversation a few days later, he told me that he could get our monthly payment in the {$1200.00} - {$1300.00} range. I asked if he could get XXXX due at closing, and he said, "" Yes, we do n't do closing costs at Quicken. '' Based on these promises, we decided to move forward and initiate the loan process with Quicken. 

Our initial Loan Estimate stated that our monthly payment would be {$1400.00}. On, XX/XX/2017, we were asked for a {$500.00} dollar good faith deposit. This had not been mentioned in any previous communication and it came as a bit of a surprise. Nevertheless, we proceeded. The very next day, XX/XX/2017, we received notification of an increase in our loan estimate. It was now {$1400.00}. I did not appreciate how this increase was not communicated and explained to us with a phone call. Rather, it was disguised as just another document that we needed to sign on the online interface. 

Furthermore, when I sent an email to XXXX XXXX to inquire about the discrepancy between the XXXX and XXXX estimates, he said that the difference was primarily due to changes in insurance and taxes, and the principle and interest portions of the second estimate had not changed from the original. I have attached documents that demonstrate this is false. 

The closing disclosure was sent to us on XX/XX/2017. This stipulated a significant increase in closing costs, now totaling over XXXX. When I contacted XXXX to discuss this discrepancy - going from XXXX down at closing to XXXX, he asserted that it was due to an increase in our county taxes. How could this not have been known during the XXXX previous loan estimates? He offered to roll the closing costs into the loan, which would increase our monthly payment "" a few dollars. '' This offer was never executed. 

Meanwhile, we received multiple phone calls every day to try and set us up with a closing date. Even after we told multiple people that we needed more time to think about it, we still had multiple calls a day. When we explained why we were waiting - how we were told things that changed multiple times, we were given very contradictory explanations and reasons for these changes. 

We contacted XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2017 in hopes of resolving some of these issues. We told her our story and our fundamental frustration at the ever increasing numbers and our lack of trust with the process with Quicken. She said that Quicken never gives out estimates until they have all the required documents. At that point, our phone cut out as we were driving in a remote area. 

XXXX XXXX called me back on XX/XX/2017 with XXXX XXXX on the line. They said that they could n't do anything with the numbers of the loan itself, but they could offer us a {$250.00} good faith credit. After discussing it with my wife, I told XXXX on XX/XX/2017 that despite the fact that the process had been less than ideal, we would like to move forward. She called me back five minutes later and left a voicemail saying that the {$250.00} good faith credit would no longer be offered because we were already "" maxed out on our credits. '' Despite this, we still considered moving forward. Then, XXXX XXXX called on XX/XX/2017 to try and set up closing, she informed me that the monthly payment was now up to over {$1400.00}. She could offer me no assurances that the monthly payment would n't increase if we scheduled a closing and was unable to explain the increase. 

We withdrew our loan application. We are frustrated and would like our {$500.00} deposit returned in full."		QUICKEN LOANS, INC.	OH	432XX		Consent provided	Web	2017-03-06	Closed with explanation	True	No	2372920

2017-03-07	Student loan	Federal student loan servicing	Dealing with my lender or servicer	Don't agree with fees charged	"On XXXX, I received a letter from XXXX stating that I had defaulted on my Perkins loan. This is the first communication I received since graduation about this loan. When I graduated, my loan was being held by Campus Partners, which was being purchased at the time. I created an account with Campus Partners, to pay my loan. However, they did not allow anyone to begin repayment of their loans, due to their company being purchased by another. Therefore, I was unable to pay my loan. Now since my loan is in default, they want me to pay the interest on the loan plus the principle amount. I was more than willing to pay my loans, which would have been without interest at the time. I immediately contacted XXXX, after receipt of the letter, to try to figure out how my loan became in default. They said that I needed to talk to the company ( ECSI ) who now owns my loan. Therefore I contacted ECSI by phone. When I finally was able to speak to someone, they were extremely unhelpful, and before even getting to the reason for my call, they hung up on me. Since I never got any information from them by phone, I looked for another method. They had an online chat available, so I tried chatting with them. 
From this, they said that they were sending me information, but it was all being sent back ( because they were sending it to my address without sending it to my apartment ). I questioned them on why they had the wrong address, and they said it was given to them by Campus Partners. Then I asked why they did n't contact me by phone or email? They replied that it was against my schools policy. I never got to ask why they did n't just contact my school to request my address. However, they said there is nothing they can do and I just have to pay the loan and the interest that accrued. I told them that I would be more than willing to pay my loan minus the interest, since that is what would be fair, this being the first contact I received. However they said that I needed to pay the interest as well. So I asked to talk to someone who could help me straighten this situation out. They referred me back to my school. So I contacted my school by phone and email. They said they would look into it. I just received an email today from XXXX stating that there is nothing they can do, and I just have to pay the loan plus this accrued interest. I do n't see why I have to pay interest on a loan that I never had the option of paying before the loan. The company or XXXX did n't do their due diligence in acquiring my correct address, which XXXX had. XXXX never even contacted me by phone or email ( which they set up, my XXXX email address ... ) to let me know that my loan was transferred to ECSI and that I would need to pay my loan through them. What they are doing is a complete Scam."		HEARTLAND PAYMENT SYSTEMS INC	VA	222XX	Servicemember	Consent provided	Web	2017-03-07	Closed with explanation	True	No	2372851

( Recorded phone call will confirm this ) I then made arrangement with KeyBank for the XX/XX/2017 payment. 
On XX/XX/2017 I receive a certified "" Notice of Default and Intention to Accelerate '' dated XX/XX/2017 from KeyBank 's attorney XXXX. The reinstatment amount in the letter was XXXX as of XX/XX/2017. ( Recall that Keybank accepted my XXXX payment on XX/XX/2017 and told me I was current. ) I also noticed my login with KeyBank has been "" locked '' due for Security reasons.

I explained to him that I was current and confused on why I received a certified threatening letter from XXXX XXXX. I also told XXXX I was calling to make the XX/XX/2017 as pre-arranged. He told me the XX/XX/2017 payment ( XXXX ) has not been applied to my account ( just sitting there ). XXXX then stated, the KeyBank Representative that I spoke with on XX/XX/XXXX who also took my XXXX payment to bring my account current told me everything wrong. She lied he indicated. XXXX now told me I had to call attorney office of XXXX and request a reinstatment letter. XXXX futher went on to say that I had to pay with certified funds only. This is really unsettling considering the Notice of Default that I just received makes no indication of this "" certified funds '' request or has any KeyBank employee ever told me I had to pay with "" certified funds. '' I went on to explain to XXXX that my funds cleared my bank on XX/XX/2017 and the XXXX payment was good and thus, "" certified ''. Again, I explained to XXXX I was not delinquent. XXXX then went on to say KeyBank will be mailing my XXXX back in the mail. XXXX appeared to have no clue on the status of the payment and a check being mailed. 
I am not sure why Key Bank is treating me like this. I paid the account current, Keybank took and accepted the payment on XX/XX/2017. I never heard from XXXX after the XX/XX/2017 payment was accepted until I unexpectedly received the "" Notice of Default '' dated XX/XX/2017.

I also mailed a Modification packet to Keybank at the end of last year and now Key Bank has told me they have no proof of receipt.

2017-03-07	Credit reporting		Credit reporting company's investigation	Investigation took too long	On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a procedural Request For Dispute letter to Equifax Credit Bureau listing several negative items I wanted investigated. I sent this certified mail and it was received by Equifax on XX/XX/XXXX based on the tracking information. These negative items were hurting my credit score, and as such, my quality of life. I, and they, know that they have 30 days to respond to my letter, 45 in some instances. I waited on them to respond for a full 60 days but I never received anything from them at all. No correspondence in any form, at any time. This is in clear violation of Federal Law. I then proceeded to send Equifax a Failure To Respond In 30 Days letter, Certified Mail Return Receipt on XX/XX/XXXX, which was received by Equifax on XX/XX/XXXX. I did not ask them to investigate at this point, as they had their opportunity 2 months prior. I asked them to abide by the law and by Federal guidelines and remove the listings I disputed, as per Federal code. I have not received any correspondence from them concerning this matter. Credit Reporting Agencies MUST abide by the laws and statutes set forth by the FTC and CFPB.		EQUIFAX, INC.	FL	324XX		Consent provided	Web	2017-03-07	Closed with explanation	True	No	2373822
2017-03-07	Student loan	Federal student loan servicing	Dealing with my lender or servicer	Received bad information about my loan	"I was steered into a deferment program and was not informed I 'd be accruing interest during the deferment period. I was not informed of any other repayment options. Payments were misapplied on days other than automatic payment that were applied to interest and not principal balance. A loan I was set to pay off in a couple years was put into a long term loan without permission ultimately causing me to pay so much more in interest over the years. 
While enrolled at XXXX university I was notified that although I started the semester there was n't enough financial aid to cover so the counselor found private loans to cover the difference, I was not explained interest rates nor was I given any documentation of these loans. I was only sent an email that she was able to find loans to cover my tuition so that I would not be kicked out of school. I just agreed in fear that I would n't be able to attended class and it would put me behind in my program. The adviser never followed up with me to go over my loans nor instructed me of the details of the loans. After graduating, I was harassed by XXXX and told I owed {$8000.00} or I would not get my degree. I had to beg for a payment plan where I paid around {$2000.00} up front then around {$1200.00} a month until it was paid. I started paying my student loan 6 months after graduation but the payment was so high I tried calling to lower it and was told I could n't. So I did n't pay because I could n't and then was threatened and told my loans were in default and affecting my excellent credit. I did n't know what to do until I spoke with someone who explained I could get my loans out of default but would have to enroll in deferment program where I paid around {$50.00} a month for 9 months then there would be a few months until my loans were taken over and out of deferment and I would start paying then. I was never informed I was accruing interest and did not know I had multiple loans with varying interest rates - rates 3x the national rate. I was never explained anything nor given any information explaining my loans and what they all meant. It 's like the computer was orchestrating my finances behind my back. When I got out of deferment my monthly payment was MORE a than my payment I could n't afford. It was around {$800.00} a month ... I paid the first month bevause I was scared I 'd ruin all the work I 'd done in the last year and then when I finally figured out how to access my loans online I reached out to navient and spoke with someone and was able to get my payment lower because I was now a stay at home mom and did n't have an income however the {$800.00} I paid the months before could not be refunded - it we straight to the interest ... which has accrued nearly {$8000.00} since the deferment program. There were also issues with automatic payment setup - it took a month to take affect so I had to pay by phone and then the automatic payment set up on a different day so it calculated more interest since it was a date that navient chose. I reached out to navient and did not hear back regarding this. I feel like navient cheated me and took advantage of me during my weakest moments. I also feel that because of the way they applied payments to loans of their choosing, I was no longer eligible for certain options. I was told I was in a 25 year repayment program however when I had someone look at my account they said it was actually a 30 year repayment program. I 'd like to get all the financial information regarding all my loans that I 've ever taken out, including proof on my private loans that I agreed to what I was signed up for and where those monies went. There seems to be missing money. I 'd like all the information regarding the forebearance and deferment program I was enrolled in and also all the details of interest rates and loan terms. I 'd like someone to look into why I was enrolled ina high payment program after deferment."		Navient Solutions, LLC.	FL	334XX		Consent provided	Web	2017-03-07	Closed with explanation	True	No	2374818

2017-03-07	Bank account or service	Checking account	Account opening, closing, or management		This all started on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I contacted Chase at XXXX ( claim number XXXX ) about charges that were wrongfully charged by a company by the name of XXXX ( XXXX ) I informed them that XXXX charged by account {$99.00} & {$97.00} posted on my account on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I spoke with a gentleman and her informed me to cancel my order so I follow his instruction ( XXXX & XXXX ). He said Chase will do the investigation and will follow back up with me once they complete with the investigation. That same day I received an email from Chase following up with my case and assigned me a claim number XXXX. I waited and no one ever contacted me back. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I contacted Chase about more transaction I did not authorized which they sent me an email with a case number XXXX. Not long after at XXXX XXXX I received an email from Chase stating that they completed with the investigation and they are putting {$14.00} back on my account. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I contacted Chase back and said I never heard back from them about the XXXX transactions I did n't authorized. They said they did not know what 's going on and assigned me another case. At XXXX XXXX I received an email from Chase with a case number XXXX. I also faxed XXXX Chase with all supporting document. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX I received an email from Chase stating that they are placing a temporary credit on my account while they research my claim. Once again I did n't get a call back so I assumed everything is taken care of. Come to my surprise on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX the charges are back on my account in the amount of {$97.00} & {$99.00}. I contacted Chase back to try to find out what was going on and this is where the nightmare truly starts. When I contacted Chase the first call will automatically routed to someone oversea. Each time I called I have to explain my situation over and over again. Those agents do not have access to my activities so all they can do is say what is prompted on his/her computer. They are very proud so each time I called they made me feel like I 'm trying to cheat the system to get back the charges I submitted. I finally asked them to transfer me to their supervisor ( come to find out this is not a supervisor they are senior advisors which located back in the U.S. ). I asked senior advisor to please read my complaint but each time they asked me to tell them what 's going on again and again. It made me feel like they 're trying to validate if my story have changed so they can deny my claim. After about XXXX senior advisor I went into a local Chase branch and told a manager there what 's going on so her gave me an executive phone number XXXX. Once again I have to tell executive office my story which I do n't mind since this should be the last time I have to tell my story. My case was assigned to an executive employee by the name of XXXX XXXX extension XXXX. She was very apologetic when she first contacted me then once again everything went south. She informed me that I should n't have cancel the account in the first place because that cause them not to have an ability to pursue XXXX. I told it was Chase agent that advised me to cancel so how is this my mistake? She continue to say there was n't anything they can do. I told them they can refund me my money because it was their agent that misinformed me. She said she could n't do that so I asked her to transfer me to her manager. I also informed her that I will contact CFPB as well. She said I may or may not receive a call back from her manager and I was more than welcome to contact CFPB.		JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

2015-09-22	Consumer Loan	Vehicle loan	Taking out the loan or lease		"I obtained a loan through Superior Finance in XXXX Missouri on a XXXX BMW X5 for {$6500.00} plus all of their fees that have been added to it ( I now owe nearly {$10000.00} after all of their added fees ). I have been fighting with them since I made my first payment. First they were reporting incorrect information to my credit. It took over 2 months of fighting for them to change it to state "" auto loan '' rather than it looking like a huge payday loan. Also when I obtained this loan, I went with this company because I was promised reporting to all XXXX major credit agencies. That is not happening. They are reporting to XXXX. The local office made myself and my husband a lot of promises that were not fulfilled, the credit reporting being one, as well as the "" warranty '' that was offered and I paid for was told to me to be "" bumper to bumper '' and does not cover anything of what they said. They have PURPOSELY defrauded me and my husband. When I brought this to the attention of the regional manager for Superior Finance ( only after threatening lawsuit ) I was connected with the attorney that the company has on permanent retainer. I have tried numerous times, unsuccessfully, for them to abide by the verbal, as well as the written contact and they refuse. I have every e mail sent and received from their attorney as well as the regional manager and all I have sent to them demanding action. He, along with their regional manager, are now ignoring my demands for them to fulfill what I was told and promised when I obtained this loan. I am fulfilling my contract by paying them nearly {$350.00} a month and keeping full coverage on this vehicle, I need them to fulfill their end of this contract in regards to reporting ( which was the entire purpose of obtaining this loan, to build credit. I had a great car that I owned outright but wanted to build my credit to obtain a mortgage ) and doing what they are supposed to do as my lender. When I realized that they had been in violation of many things in the contract, and I had to threaten lawsuit to get their attention, I even offered to return the car ( in better condition than when was received ) and for both parties to walk away free and clear. They did not want to hold up their end of the contract and I do not want to pay an arm and a leg for a vehicle that is nothing what I was promised, they refused my offer. I have XXXX other individuals that this company has done the same/similar to and they are more than willing to join lawsuit if needed and I have no doubt I could find more. This is a very crooked, deceiving company and I am not willing to sit back and allow them to manipulate me and defraud myself and others. I was made promises by them and there is a signed contract .... none of that is being fulfilled by Superior Finance. At the VERY LEAST, I am wanting them to report to all XXXX credit agencies as was promised which I have been informed was part of a verbal contract between myself and Superior Finance Company. They need to be held accountable for what their employees promise, just as I am held accountable for my payments and other contract obligations. If they refuse to follow through with the terms of the written and verbal contract after this formal complaint, I will have no choice but to proceed with legal action."		ARVEST BANK GROUP, INC.

This person used my information to collect my tax returns for those two years. I am in the process of repairing my finances as a result and just recently began the journey to credit worthiness. 

This account is one of the accounts I did not recognize on my credit report and on XX/XX/XXXX I sent a letter to the Portfolio Discovery disputing a debt collection activity that I noticed on my credit report. I requested documentation with proof bearing my signature. I also stated that if they could not provide me with proof in 30 days, based on the FCRA it is their responsibility to remove this account.

However, I did not receive a response.

To this date, I have not received a response. This company has failed to provide any documentation that shows I owned this account. It is obvious that they do not have the proof to do so.

I had used XXXX before and had good results. Now he is married and his wife involvement broke down all communication. 
She was quick to discontinue all communication between XXXX and me and told me not to contact him, only her. 
I checked on the carpet almost weekly for 2 months. I had planned to have the carpet done from a carpet dealer but they talked me out of it, even offered me carpet they had, which they recanted. I really did n't want theirs, wanted to match mine and of course get the mold out as soon as possible. Every time I stayed, I came home sick. 
They offered to do other things that I agreed to, but only the first portion of the work was done, which I have already paid {$630.00} for. 
Then after countless emails, text, I was told that the carpet they bought was ruined by the person they had bind it. There were no definite plans was in place to fix my camper. I then decided to discontinue the service and go to another direction. 
Then, his wife, XXXX, starting issuing threat after threat. I tried very hard to resolve this but could n't get anywhere with her. She even accused me of insurance fraud, which I 'm sure my estimator would testify that he ask me about my couch and I told him not to worry about it, I just want my camper livable. 
She then gave me 10 days to pay a falsified invoice {$1200.00} or she would turn it over to collections. I was not able to go there within that 10 days ( it is 2 hours away from my home ) so I ask the RV park to check on some of the charges and I have the emails included that the XXXX outside items he could see ( battery or brake line ) were NOT installed. 
I paid {$23.00} to overnight a check for {$91.00} with a breakdown of what I thought was fair ( see included ). I was sent additional harassing messages by XXXX, even after I ask her to send me what she was talking about so we could work through it but I was told it was going to collections. 
I then receive the letter from Professional Collection Co. I called and spoke to XXXX there and offered all the documentation to prove these charges were falsified but she would not take any steps to try to resolve the situation. 
I went this week on Wednesday XX/XX/2017 and found the same. I took at picture of the battery box, water in it, and no battery for ages. My keys have not been returned, so XXXX XXXX XXXX still have complete access to every area of my camper, even storage.

When consumers telephone the Lexis-Nexis Privacy Information manager at XXXX they and ask for opt-out and security freeze ( as those terms are defined by federal law ) from Accurint a representative will offer security freeze of their RiskView product or direct consumers to an opt-out page for PeopleWise or KnowX. These products are distinctly different from Accurint, which is regulated by the FCRA. In fact, Lexis-Nexis is aware of this and states on their webpage XXXX that the opt-out procedures stated thereon applies to a "" Non-FCRA Opt-out Policy ''. That page invents new undefined terms like "" information suppressions '' and conflates the various Lexis-Nexis products without even naming Accurint. It does mention KnowX and PeopleWise but any reasonable person reading the page would think that a person has to be one of "" Public and elected officials, including law enforcement officers, and private individuals who are facing a substantial risk of physical harm or who are victims of identity theft. '' However, this is NOT the case for suppression from KnowX and PeopleWise which anyone can opt-out of. The policy involving those classes of consumers applies to Accurint and there is nothing on that page or on the internet which states a clear procedure for opting out of Accurint. 

In fact, one year ago, I requested to opt-out of Accurint and/or place a security freeze on that product. I telephoned the number above and sent in a copy of a report mailed to me from XXXX stating that I was the victim of a security breach. Lexis-Nexis informed me falsely that my information from that database had been suppressed.

In settling this class action suit in 2014 by paying a XXXX class action settlement Lexis-Nexis promised to change its policies and become "" a model of the industry ''. Instead, it remains as murky as ever as to how to be removed from Accurint. There is no clear stated policy on Lexis-Nexis ' web pages anywhere as to removal. Instead, Lexis-Nexis conflates its removal policy for various distinctly different products and misleads the public as to what product consumers are being removed from.

I have disputed the fraudulent debts with all relevant credit bureaus, resulting in deletion because they cold not verify the debts through the automated dispute system. They never sent me notices for all but XXXX of them, and damaged my credit until disputed and deleted. This happened approximately 8-9 times with XXXX. I know this is not really a violation ( unfortunately they will lie about notices ), but it should be. They knew they could n't verify from the time they reported. What they have done in violation of the FCRA, is sold, transferred a fraudulent debt after an identity theft block ( XXXX ) was placed on a fraudulent debt they reported. I submitted block request to XXXX for the debt back in XX/XX/XXXX, and the debt was deleted within the specified time under FCRA. I can only assume it was blocked by XXXX, since it was deleted, and XXXX did not send me any notice regarding refusing to block, which the law would require if they did. Again, all of this means they placed a block on the XXXX debt, and should have notified XXXX that this debt was a result of identity theft. The fraudulent debt had an original creditor, current creditor, and collection agency that was to be collecting on the debt. XXXX of XXXX County, the original creditor, knows nothing about this debt and told me to contact the Attorney General. This was the only debt reported that I received notice from CFSI for, so I requested debt validation in the 30 day time allowed to dispute a debt. Their "" debt validation '' is a JOKE, and has Fraud written all over it. The papers they sent me looked like someone obtained my personal info from sources, and plugged in to their pathetic excuse of a debt validation. The information did not match the timeline of my true life events at the "" time of service ''. The dates, XX/XX/XXXX for insurance billed, and well, I 'll let you decide the ridiculous attempt at fraud for yourself. Also, these fraudsters obviously do n't have spell check, which makes them even more pathetic. The "" debt validation '' has spelling errors, refering physician, and amount refered? This accurate spelling is "" referred '' or "" referring '' you XXXX, look it up. So after XXXX blocked this debt, approximately 3 weeks later, I receive a collection notice from XXXX XXXX XXXX for the SAME debt. The debt is same amount, same original creditor, same current creditor, just different collection agency this time. Really? I was a victim of identity theft, resulting in XXXX page police report, and they should not even have my personal information, they have no legal reason to, and they continue to share it, add to another database which adds more risk of it getting stolen again. They violated the law by selling, transferring, placing for collection a debt that they were told, or should 've been told was a result of identity theft. It is their responsibility to have reasonable measures in place to make sure this DOES NOT happen, and XXXX should have made sure the debt was dissolved once notified, but they knew it was fraudulent before that. If they do n't have reasonable measures to prevent this, they should be shut down. They think they are above the law, and they are in the business of collecting fraudulent debt, this just confirms that is exactly their end game. I mean, they ca n't even spell correctly on their "" debt validation '', which is beyond pathetic. The original creditor tells me to call Attorney General, so what does that say about this on top of the obvious? XXXX has also called my cell phone, which I never authorized, and never gave them my mobile phone number.

I asked her why her company had contracted with a local contractor to enter the property without a court order, told her she had no legal authority to do so and told her that I had just called the police, and she hung up. At that point the police officer arrived, and I gave my statement ; he then went outside with the contractor to obtain his statement. He oversaw the re-installation of the new lock and door knob, since the original had been destroyed, and the clean up to a reasonable level of cleanliness and water removal of the mess the two had made around the water heater. The police officer explained that he did not believe the contractor believed what he was doing was illegal and trespassing is a crime of intent, so he would not be charging the contractor with a crime, but he told me I might want to contact the State Attorney General because it is very interested when corporations or financial institutions violate the law, but that the local police had no interest in pursuing the case further. When outside in the driveway before he left, I told the XXXX, XXXX XXXX, that in the future, at this home or any other in XXXX State, you need to demand a court order showing you have the authority to enter a house before you may break into it. I also told him the bank has all my contact information and all you need to do is contact me, and if I deem it appropriate, I 'll let you in voluntarily.

Monday on XXXX 's "" Mornings With XXXX, '' the author of "" XXXX, '' XXXX, discussed a new report from the Government Accountability Institute ( GAI ) that found the Obama administration 's Department of Justice has been directing fines levied on major banks to fund leftist groups. 
Partial transcript as follows : XXXX : Let me ask you about another exclusive report we want to get to. When banks are sued by the Justice Department -- we know right now that the department is trying to get upwards of XXXX dollars from XXXX. We do n't know what that a number is ultimately going to be. Where does that money go? Does it allegedly help fund political nonprofit groups? Because this is what the Government Accountability Institute is saying, and we 've got this exclusive report. 
XXXX Yes, that is right, XXXX, we 've got a report coming out today. Anybody can get it -- XXXX. What we looked at is what the Obama Department of Justice has done when they have gone after banks, whether is was related to mortgage-backed securities or lending practices going back to the XX/XX/2008 financial crisis, and what you find is that a lot of money is not actually going to pay the victims. That money is being steered by the Department of Justice to fund progressive liberal organizations. More than XXXX dollars worth. And that money is being steered toward political activism. And in fact, the Department of Justice giving these large financial institutions, which have allegedly you know, conducted in bad behavior, they are giving them a XXXX dollar to XXXX discount. If they will give a dollar to a progressive organization, that wipes XXXX dollars off the slate in terms of what they owe federal government as related to their financial activities. So this is a massive problem. It shows that a lot of activities -- the Department of Justice under President Obama -- has not been about actual making the victims whole as it relates to these financial activities, but actually funding left wing groups. 

I will bring all you dirt bags down who have committed fraud against me.

My father made 3 different payments of {$9500.00} and come to find out years later, they applied the payments as regular monthly payments which went completely to interest and not a cent to principle. I was n't made aware of this until years later when I ran out of forbearance options and they would not accept what I was offering them monthly. As a result they ended up charging off XXXX of the loans and the allowing me to enter into a repayment plan paying the same amount I was originally offered before they charged this off on my credit. I just feel as though they took me for a ride and paying the ultimate consequence because I was not properly Informed.

2017-03-07	Credit card		Delinquent account		In 2016 while making a purchase at Target I was asked if I wanted to apply for a Target card to receive 5 % off my {$28.00} purchase. I agreed, I apply and I was approved for a Target Store Card. Weeks passed and I never received my Target card, and frankly I forgot about my {$28.00} purchase. Months later I am contacted by Target Card Services and told that my account is in collections for over {$130.00}. I am told that the balance is a result of my initial {$28.00} purchase plus late fees and interest. We discover during the conversation that Target Card Service had my address incorrect. I appears that the Target representative who I handed my drivers license to when I made my {$28.00} purchase, incorrectly entered my address into the Target Card system. Subsequently, Target Card Services sent my Target Card and statements to the wrong address. I updated my address with Target Card Service and quickly agreed to pay the initial purchase amount of about {$28.00}. However, I refused to pay the late fee and interest since Target Card Service incorrectly captured my address and failed to send me the card or statement balance. Target Card Service acknowledged that they incorrectly entered my address at the time the Target Card application was taken but they have taken a very hard stance on the late fees and interest, and have refused to remove them from the account, even though they acknowledge their error. Now they are attempting to collect the outstanding {$100.00} and have report it to my credit report resulting in my credit score dropping from XXXX to XXXX. I think it is grossly unfair for Target Card Services to acknowledge they captured the wrong address, sent my new Target Card to the wrong address and continued to send my Target Card statements to the wrong address and then attempt to collect {$100.00} in fee and interest. As soon as Target Card Services contacted me, I paid the initial purchase by phone to them.

I had a lapse in income after retiring while waiting for my XXXX checks to begin and as a result fell behind on my mortgage with Nationstar. Now that I am receiving a regular check from XXXX and with my wife 's income we can resume making our mortgage payments. The problem is that Nationstar will not accept our payment.

As a result we now have a foreclosure sale date set for XXXX XXXX, XXXX. This should not be happening because we can afford a fair payment if Nationstar just gave us a chance at a modification. 

My wife and I refinanced our home in XXXX. When I began having XXXX XXXX in XXXX and was unable to work we were allowed to apply for a loan modification and were approved. We made these payments without any problems until I XXXX in XXXX which left me unable to work. At this time the loan had been transferred to Nationstar. I do n't know why Nationstar is not even considering our current financial situation and working with us towards a restructured loan. I think it would be better for everyone and more money for Nationstar if they worked with us and allowed us to stay in the house instead of foreclosing on us. We are not that far behind on the loan and our balance is low as well. I definitely believe if Nationstar took the time to review our information we would qualify for help."

2017-03-07	Consumer Loan	Vehicle loan	Taking out the loan or lease		In XXXX 2014 I purchased a new XXXX from a local dealership in XXXX. My downpayment in cash was over 50 % of the total vehicle cost and the dealership financed the balance over 3 years with Huntington National Bank with whom I had never previously done business. My credit rating is very high and I provided proof of more-than-adequate private insurance coverage on the new vehicle. Since I wished to pay off the loan earlier than 3 years I would often send 2 or 3 payments in one check with the accompanying tear-off coupons from the book sent me by Huntington. The final coupon instructed me to call for a pay-off amount, which I did. Since the pay-off amount quoted was somewhat higher than I expected since I had paid off the loan 11 months early, I queried this. I stated that I had never been mailed any sort of statement by Huntington as to how my payments had been applied, how they arrived at the pay-off amount, etc. I was told that the pay-off quoted included a {$40.00} insurance premium for what turned out to be a forced insurance situation that would have covered Huntington had my insurance been cancelled during the life of the loan ( it had not and remains in full force and effect ) or if my car had been totaled ( and presumably Huntington would not get sufficient settlement to pay off the loan balance ) - the car has never been in an accident. I contended I should not be forced to pay this but paid 'under protest ' and then filed a complaint with the OCC , having first tried to resolve the issue over the phone with Huntington 's corporate office - to no avail. Filing the OCC complaint got me a brief phone call from the same corporate woman I had already spoken with previously and a follow-up letter enclosing certain copies - one of which purported to be the print-out of all the payments I had made through the 2 years 1 month. However, the print-out not only only covered the last 11 months of the loan ( the first 13 months were missing ) but it merely showed the monthly amount reflected on each coupon and the date each payment was due - not, as had actually happened, the actual amounts of the various checks I had sent to Huntington. I would be very glad to hear from all Huntington auto loan customers who have experienced the same issue as I always believe there is strength in numbers. Not only that but, quite by chance, a car salesman at the dealership where I had purchased the vehicle told me ( when I called to complain to them, too, about this matter ) that he had been charged at point of pay-off on his car loan and that he had complained and ultimately ( after 5 or 6 months ) Huntington had sent him a refund check in the mail for a little more than the amount he complained he had overpaid. Of course, it might be that since he worked for a car dealership that hawks Huntington auto loans, whereas I do not, that he got preferential treatment - I dont know.

I have kept my financial obligation with Chase since getting my mortgage back on track. While acknowleges that they have the ability to do reage my account, they will only do so if you enter into a mortgage assistance program.

I have worked hard to reestablish my credit with Chase and others and this negative information is impeding my progress. Thus, I am coming to CFPB to assist with negotiations to have my account updated to reflect the positive status for 6+ years.

2017-03-07	Student loan	Federal student loan servicing	Dealing with my lender or servicer	Don't agree with fees charged	"NOTE- this is separate from my other complaint with the CFPB re: FedLoan, that is currently in progress. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I logged into my FedLoan account to schedule my XX/XX/XXXX payment (due XX/XX/XXXX). My account stated that my account was overdue. Confused (I pay my monthly, income-driven repayment amount of $XXXX each month), I read further. A random amount of $XXXX was applied to my account. This makes no sense- I am in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program (PSLF), meaning I pay each month through the income-driven repayment plan, which is determined annually when I submit paperwork. Last year, based on income and family size, my payment was determined to be $XXXX/month, XXXX - XXXX. I have no clue where $XXXX came from, and it was never reflected on my monthly billing statement. I called on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to XXXX (employee # XXXX). She shared my confusion; she put me on a long hold and tried to determine where this charge came from, but couldn't determine it. She stated it was 'odd' and she hadn't seen a charge be randomly applied. She firmly stated that I pay the correct amount (for XX/XX/XXXX, it is $XXXX, and in XX/XX/XXXX my new income-drive repayment plan based on my recertification paperwork will be $XXXX, effective XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX). She advised me to pay 'what I actually owe based on my income-driven repayment plan' and she would put a note in the system. She also said she would send it to investigations. As of today (XX/XX/XXXX), my account is 18 days past due. I received a notice of my delinquency. I called FedLoan again and they said it was still in investigation, and that bad credit reporting won't occur until 90 days. They again reinforced that I should pay what I 'actually' owe and that the mysterious $XXXX should be resolved in 90 days. I am concerned it won't be- I have very good credit, and have worked hard for that score. I am mindful of all bills and have never paid a bill late, FedLoan and others. I do not want my score to be harmed by this issue with FedLoan. The employees cannot explain how this random charge dropped on my account, but they assured me it will be removed. I, however, have experienced multiple issues with FedLoan, particularly in the past year. I am very concerned. XXXX, the employee I spoke to on XX/XX/XXXX noted that my account appeared 'perfect,' meaning I always submit required paperwork on-time and pay my monthly bill. I am very concerned this account will harm me, despite doing everything right. I fear as I approach the end of 90 days, I will be forced to pay an amount I don't owe, or face a ding in my credit score. This isn't right."

2017-03-07	Mortgage	Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM)	Loan modification,collection,foreclosure		This complaint concerns Indy Mac Bank. There are several issues to discuss concerning Indy Mac. First, I was told that I had to miss payments in order to be qualified to modify my loan. Secondly we were in the process of applying for a modification under the HAMP plan with Indy Mac, and they dual tracked us. We would receive foreclosure notices while in the midst of HAMP application, review and approval, up until the last moment. Thirdly, after I carefully submitted paperwork for review, Indy Mac would either call and say they never received it, or it had expired, and the entire application would have to begin again. Lastly, this whole process took nearly a year, the whole time being threatened with foreclosure. I wrote the State of Georgia Attorney General 's Office, called several National Hotlines for help and faxed Pres. Obama 's administration a complaint about the way I was being treated. Almost immediately after that, my loan modification was approved. At that time-XXXX, there was not legislation against dual tracking and requiring a homeowner to miss payments. I understand that is now in effect, and I am asking for relief from Indy Mac ( now XXXX Bank ). This process affected my health and XXXX immensely. I had XXXX very young children at the time, and looking back at that one year process and the negligence with which they handled the application process was a very bad memory. I understand now that certain mortgage companies have been and are being held liable for their actions during this time. Thank you.

2017-03-07	Credit card		Identity theft / Fraud / Embezzlement		"On XXXX/XXXX/17 I was notified by my XXXX carrier, Capital One Bank, of {$4000.00} in fradulent charges to the XXXX online store. My XXXX had been hacked and my identity was used to make the purchases. The hackers were able to change my password, lock me out of my XXXX, manipulate my e-mails, remotely print out a gift card from my XXXX and foward my telephone calls to a bogus cellphone number in order to keep me from discovering the hack. In investigating how this could occur, I discovered that XXXX enters into surreptitious ( probably financial ) agreements with certain vendors to provide them with updated credit card numbers without the knowledge or consent of the cardholder ( also true apparently of XXXX and others ). They call it the "" XXXX account updater ''. That process is what allowed the fraud to occur, as XXXX did not have an active card on file for me. The charges should have been denied, and that would have immediately ended the fraud attempt. XXXX told me on the phone that I could "" opt out '' with the issuer ( Capital One ). Capital One said it was XXXX responsibility. In a three way phone call that I initiated that included myself, XXXX and Capital One, they just argued about who had responsibility. The Capital One rep denied even knowing about the updater procedure, and actually said at one point that someone at Capital One that neither I nor he "" would ever be able to talk to '' may have entered into such an agreement. Neither would reveal the opt out procedure to me. It seems to me that these behind the scenes deals made without the consumer 's knowledge should be outlawed. At the least, we should be able to "" opt in '' if we view this as a personal convenience ( beyond the huge convenience that it obviously provides for the vendors ), and at the very least there should be a clear and easy way to "" opt out ''. For the consumer, who is at risk of monetary loss as well as massive inconvenience, to be excluded from the decisionmaking process regarding the release of his personal information is completely outrageous.

2017-03-07	Student loan	Federal student loan servicing	Can't repay my loan	Can't get flexible payment options	I was told by XXXX that my daughter could not get a loan because she had no credit established so they offered me a PLUS loan to get her started. At that time they did not tell me that I could decline the loan and that my daughter would have still been able to get a school loan without my help. I was a single mother and struggling financially so I deferred these loans as much as I could only paying here and there but still trying. My payments stayed pretty much the same for years. Then Navient took over. After struggling through a very expensive divorce I got behind in my payments to them so I deferred once more. So starting in XX/XX/XXXX I started paying on my loans and my payments were {$200.00} which I could do. Then I started getting notices that I was behind on payments. I went back and looked and from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX I had made {$1200.00} in payments ( I started at the end of XX/XX/XXXX and was making {$200.00} payments every XXXX weeks ) but when I would look up my loans online it showed I was still behind by almost {$800.00}. I started looking at my statements and realized that they increased my payments In XX/XX/XXXX from {$200.00} to {$350.00} and then starting in XX/XX/XXXX my payments would go up to {$370.00}. I called Navient and told them I could not afford to pay {$370.00} and why did my payments increase and they could not give me an answer. They said my only solution was to file for forbearance and they would cancel out the money I owe for back payments. I told them I did not want to file for forbearance again because that would only increase the interest that I would owe. They told me that was my only way to catch up on my payments. It is so totally unfair that you try to help your children get a good education and try to help them out but end up paying for the rest of your life because the interest on school loans.

2017-03-07	Mortgage	Conventional fixed mortgage	Loan modification,collection,foreclosure		"My wife and I have ""owned"" this home since XXXX.  When we bought the home in XXXX, we had a mortgage with XXXX which sold it to Nationstar.  We are the parents of XXXX children and until XXXX of XXXX, we have been a family of 8 on 1 income.  My wife went back to work in XXXX at the school that my children attend  and with careful planning and budgeting it should have helped, but it didn't.  We've spent so long robbing XXXX to pay XXXX that we were ignorant in our efforts to establish a coherent budget that we could follow.  We were caught up on the mortgage through XXXX and then one missed payment became many.  Towards the end of XXXX we received our monthly statement from Nationstar stating we had an amount due of $XXXX.  We were prepared to pay this with our tax return, hoping to get caught up and make on time monthly payments and get out of this hole that we're in.  But unfortunately, it doesn't work like that.   I called them on Friday, XXXX to make the payment and was told I had to call back on XXXX.  Ok, no problem.  They gave no other information and no indication that there would be a problem.  So, on XXXX my wife called.  I work 3rd shift and was sleeping, so she called to try to get this resolved.  They informed her that we are in ""active foreclosure"" and that our account was sent to foreclosure on XXXX.  Wait, what?  My wife and I take full responsibility for being in the situation that we're in, we screwed up.  Here's the part that I have an issue with...  At no time did they contact us.  Not once.  There were no phone calls, no voice mails, no standard mail or certified mail. Not even an email.  Absolutely nothing.  The only correspondence we've received from them has been our monthly statement.  Which aside from indicating that we were late and owed a ton of money gave no other information.  In order to remedy this situation, we now need to pay $XXXX to a law firm that has been retained by Nationstar.  Again, we have gotten no correspondence from them either.  If we as consumers are held responsible for our actions by way of financial punishments (i.e. foreclosure, etc.) when do the financial institutions get held accountable for not following due process?  It's very frustrating.  So, since XXXX, I have been working with a XXXX housing counselor and I contacted CFPB to see if they could shed any insight on my situation.  I've done this with the understanding that they may not be able to do anything to help, but my hope was that they could at least offer some insight and point me in the right direction.  And so far I have not been disappointed.  Unfortunately, I am still at the mercy of Nationstar to grant me a loan modification, in the hopes of saving my house.  To anybody reading this, I would say this:  Do not wait until it's too late to take advantage of resources that may help you fix a situation, or avoid one altogether.  Unfortunately it doesn't take much to let things get away from you with the intent of fixing it tomorrow or next month, and then letting it drag on until it's potentially too late."

Yes my taxes have increased moderately but my payment now should be worst case {$900.00} a month and it is now, due to their incompetence, {$980.00} a month starting next month. Contacting them is a total waste of time so I 've resorted to complaining to the CFPB.

The auto pay is adjusted to take the correct new tax payment, but since the bill is not adjusted customers show that they owe a small amount due. usually less than a dollar. Kia is telling customers to pay the balance due which is a huge burdon to cancel auto pay, pay the amount and re set it back up. 

When the fact is that Car leases are paid front end, not in the rears. So XXXX 's payment should be for the new tax rate. That payment would be for XXXX to XXXX. Since the bill from Kia came in XXXX for XXXX payment they are charging for the old tax rate in XXXX, By doing this all consumers are paying the higher tax rate in XXXX WHEN THEY SHOULDNT BE!

When my loan came out of forebearance I submitted the correct paperwork online, and pulled my income over from the IRS website. When I called a few weeks later to see if my new payment form had been processed the lady informed me "" Our online applications do not work. '' I had no correspondance that this was the case and that my application was not in the que to be processed, she told me to submit a paper form. I filled out the paper form and faxed it in like directed. Again, I waited a week or two and called to check up. Again this form was denied because they needed my tax filings. AND this gentleman told me the online applications worked just fine and did not know why the previous lady had told me that. SO, I faxed in my tax filings. I again, called to follow up. The gentleman said they had everything they needed, but also wanted to inform me my PSLF employment recertification was denied because the city and state was not listed on the form. Again, I was NOT informed of this denial. So I redid that form, sent it in. A day later, my IDR application was AGAIN, denied, because of some silly error on question 4 about whether I was still in forebearance or not.

I decided to submit an additional challenge of reportability of this bankruptcy and received return information stating that bankruptcies are verified by runners who go to the courthouse. I asked what information is verified by the runner who goes to the courthouse. I asked what information does the runner give to the courthouse, and how and what kind of physical information does the runner give back to the credit bureaus.

2017-03-07	Consumer Loan	Vehicle lease	Managing the loan or lease		"Per XX/XX/XXXX MB Trust CFPB has jurisdiction. I leased a brand new XXXX Mercedes Benz CLA250 on XX/XX/XXXX. I was told that the vehicle was covered in full by a manufacturer 's warranty. Additionally I purchased a maintenance plan to cover all other repairs/maintenance that were my responsibility pursuant to terms disclosed at time of the lease. The vehicle has been to the dealer 9 times and out of service more than 63 days for serious life threatening safety issues that impair the use and value of the vehicle. Unfortunately the defects have not and will not be repaired because Mercedes Benz Financial Services through its acting as my attorney in fact cancelled the manufacturers warranty because the warranty repairs exceed the amount of money allocated for warranty repairs. Thereby, leaving me with a choice of being responsible for $ 30,000+ in repairs of defective parts or fees for early termination. DaimlerAG has a policy to deny warranty claims when they exceed the warranty repair costs allocated to each vehicle. The warranty repair costs allocated to each vehicle are determined by the purchase price of the vehicle. The more paid for the vehicle the more money allocated for warranty costs to repair the vehicle. This policy also applies to recall campaigns. Recalls are only issued for the higher end models even though the defective parts are on all MB vehicles. In total there are approximately XXXX recalls for Mercedes Benz vehicles to address issues I have been complaining about since XX/XX/XXXX. However, for my model vehicle the manufacturer has only issued service bulletins. Currently, there are more than XXXX service bulletins for defective parts on the vehicle because the costs to repair the defects exceed the amount allocated for warranty repairs and recall repairs are mandatory as opposed to service bulletins which are discretionary repairs. Once the amount allocated for warranty repairs has been reached Mercedes Benz Financial Services acts as the lessees attorney in fact and cancels the manufacturer warranty. See recall alerts, corresponding Service Bulletins, and Note XXXX XXXX pays dealers and service managers bonuses for every warranty claim denied that exceeds the amount of warranty repair costs allocated per vehicle. The bonuses are paid in the form of profit sharing arrangements and bonuses to management. To discourage dealers from repairing defects mentioned in service bulletins which would result in the submission of warranty claims that exceed the amount allocated for warranty repairs per vehicle. See Note XXXX In fact the Annual Report states ... '' A provision for expected warranty costs is recognized when a product is sold or when a new warranty program is initiated. '' XX/XX/XXXX Annual Report page XXXX At no time was it disclosed that Mercedes misrepresents the amount of vehicles with defective products and life threatening safety defects by limiting vehicle recalls to drivers in high value vehicles who have not made previous warranty claims. Nor was it disclosed that the manufacturer 's warranty was limited to a certain dollar amount that is pre-determined by the manufacturer and that Mercedes Benz Financial Services would act as my attorney-in-fact and cancel/amend the vehicle 's Warranty leaving me responsible for the costs to repair defects in the vehicle that were represented to me as being covered by the manufacturers warranty. This policy and practice is discriminatory and illegal because it has a disproportionate "" adverse impact '' on persons in a protected class. Additionally, MBFS failed to disclose that my vehicle and I would be part of a study called XXXX which monitors drivers and their driving habits as part of an automated driving project called XXXX. At no time was I given the option to opt out of this program. At no time was this program disclosed to me at the time of my lease."

2017-03-02	Consumer Loan	Installment loan	Problems when you are unable to pay		"I co signed on a loan that was a refinance of an existing loan of mine.  The (now retired) employee that swore to me that this was a necessary thing to do to keep the loan from going into default lured me into a deceptive loan. I have dealt with this company in the past on small loans but they assured me that taking out t his larger loan to consolidate bills was a necessity. These people make you think you are a friend and they are looking out for your best interests.  They said I needed to put this loan in my friends name (who had debts  being paid off from the loan also) because ""the friend"" had a job and if he lost his job the loan insurance would make the payments.  The terms and conditions they gave us were NOT what we had been promised. After having us sign the forms I realized interest rates were changed and was told it was a binding contract and nothing I could do.  The terms were for 5 years near the end of the 4th year financial problems were incurred and they said they would modify the loan. No papers were offered, no terms given they just said it would lower the payment. We were left to assume the terms were the same.  What I later found out (from logging into my information online, which I was not told was possible) I saw the loan was extended for 12 more years.  The friend got into some legal trouble last year and because of that had to move.  I called the local office and explained to them the situation and asked if they could give me any  help.  The manager told me that  he couldnt do anything and that I needed to pay or go to court.  I have paid this loan for over 9 years approximately and for the amount borrowed I have paid the original amount borrowed and much more. They take out all interest first and nothing goes toward principal. 7500 (approx) was borrowed and by the end of the estimated 11 more years they tacked on the loan close to 50k will be paid! That is more than my home cost!!! They now cant find the primary lender and are harassing me non stop. I tried to work with them in the beginning and they refused. I spent 20 years being XXXX raising a son alone and repaired my credit only for these blood suckers to ruin me over their deceptive practices.  I have no issue paying for something I borrowed but this is not only robbery but it is unethical. It seems nobody is out there monitoring these companies.  This is why they split XXXX to take the mortgage and OneMain to personal loans. Easier to steal more money from lenders who try but cant get conventional bank loans. Our protection is nowhere to be found from our government who should be monitoring these companies. I can see why they can't keep employees there long.

Caliber home loans is guiding people into FHA mortgages and setting them up for financial suicide. This is a report being filed on behalf of more than one person, all close friends and referrals to Caliber, who have experienced XXXX XXXX, ( XXXX # : XXXX / State Lic # XXXX ) misleading customers into mortgages they can not afford. She and her staff, backed by the Corporate Caliber, are setting people up for failure. She and her staff, guided by senior management ; XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX 's Husband ), and others at Caliber to push the approvals and final documents off to the last minute before closings to force the hand of the buyer to have to take what has been presented. 
In my, and XXXX others cases, XXXX XXXX guided us into FHA mortgages. For various reasons, we were told FHA mortgage was the "" ONLY '' option. These FHA fees are stacked on top of the monthly payments and are not able to be written off as tax liability either. Caliber Home Loans said, "" Just sign the documents and in six months to a year you can refinance and l lower your payment, $ XXXX- {$500.00} per month. '' On top of this, at the time of my purchase, I was told that I had to go with an FHA mortgage because of student loans. I have perfect credit, lots of income, and I put down over {$150000.00}. This was based on the deferment of the student loans for a year, a {$600.00} per month payment. Caliber Home Loans and XXXX XXXX knew that the payment was pushing my financial limited, but being promised that the payment would be lowered with refinancing in a year, the mentioned amount, the payment would basically be the same. 
All this is no longer true. Caliber home loans has truly operated in a manner to be the most predatory of predatory lenders and worse than XXXX who ripped off millions of American and set up the financial failures of XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. They knowing applied my {$150000.00} to set me up for failure with the hopes of me and those I have mentioned ( XXXX others ) to default on the mortgage to gain my equity and additional profits. These activities can be found in numerous other complaints across the internet. 
When XXXX XXXX was called back to "" Refinance '' she was completely unavailable and unwilling to even look at the mortgage and lower the payment as promised. She was originally contacted in XX/XX/XXXX, over a year after making all payments on time and still with 100 % perfect credit and she refused to help. She was contacted and then led me on for months on end and beyond the point of rates going up in XX/XX/XXXX. She then become very politically driven to blame "" Trump '' for why I could not refinance and why rates went up. This was less than days after his inauguration. Since then, her boss, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX # : XXXX / State Lic # XXXX XXXX got involved. She was the most unprofessional person I have dealt with.

2017-03-07	Bank account or service	Checking account	Making/receiving payments, sending money		"Unfortunately, I have a XXXX complaint to file in less than a full year against Citizens Bank, NA for awful banking policies and payment schedules. Again, I feel as though I am being taken advantage of by an institution in which I put my trust for my banking needs and services. 

To make a long story short, I set up some authorized debits for payment to other service providers during the week of XXXX. In fact, the XXXX providers in which I was scheduling payment for was XXXX services and Citizens Bank Credit Card services. Both of these payments were scheduled and processed on Thursday, XXXX XXXX. Of course, Citizens processed their credit card payment immediately, which posted to my account the following day on Friday, XXXX XXXX, 2017. Unfortunately, they withheld the payment to XXXX and placed the payment in my authorized holds and funds on my account. Well, the weekend passed, and the payment had still not posted on Monday, XXXX XXXX, 2017. It seemed as though my payments to other institutions were frozen, despite having had more than enough funds to make the payment. 

Fast forward to today, Tuesday, XXXX XXXX. I woke up and checked my account, as I am expecting a paycheck to clear and be posted to my account. To my surprise, the payment to XXXX is posted and processed for Monday, XXXX XXXX, 2017. Lucky for Citizens, this immediately over drafted me. Normally, if a payment posts to my account that will normally overdraft me, I have until XXXX that same evening to post a payment and bring my balance to the positive. Unfortunately, I was not given this opportunity, nor was I alerted that the processed payment to XXXX was posted. Instead, I was able to see the payment the day after it was supposedly processed to which I also received a overdraft fee attached. 

I have not encountered this particular set of circumstances in the past, and I am surprised that Citizens would actually allow a policy that causes so much confusion and frustration to stay in place. This is also not to mention that I have Overdraft Protection on my account to keep my purchases from going over my available funds. Once again, I feel like I have been duped by a large banking institution based on their inability to communicate proper payment schedules. Additionally, it is disheartening to know that they do not have the integrity to process payments in a timely manner to prevent these types of situations from reoccurring. It would be one thing if all of my pre-authorized debits had been placed on hold and processed on XXXX XXXX, but it is clear that Citizens gave their own payments priority over another institution 's to the extent that when they finally processed my payment to XXXX it was inevitably going to overdraft me. 

This is especially concerning due to the fact that the payments did not even show up on my posted payments, holds, and funds on citizensbank.com. In essence, there was no way to prevent an additional charge or payment from generating an overdraft, because the calculated funds left in my account were not accurate or up to date."

2017-03-07	Student loan	Federal student loan servicing	Dealing with my lender or servicer	Trouble with how payments are handled	I have several federal loans through Navient, and I am aggressively paying off the highest interest rate loan(s) first on top of the auto-debit program.  Whenever I make additional payments to the loan (XXXX) with the highest interest rate, I always choose not to move back my payment for the auto-debit.  I noticed that once the auto-debit occurs, it will only subtract the interest for XXXX, and not put any money towards the principle.  The extra money from the auto debit is allocated among the other loans I have, which all have the same or smaller interest amounts.  I have contacted Navient 6 times in a month to have everything retro-actively billed correctly, and to have future auto debit payments be allocated correctly.  They assured me that it has been fixed and that the next auto payment will apply the payments correctly to each loan, regardless of any extra payments I made to XXXX.  When the next billing cycle passed, I noticed that it was still only auto-debiting the interest on XXXX, and not making a dent into the principle.  I had to talk to a supervisor at Navient and he said there was a software issue that they are trying to fix and that in the meantime, the only way to ensure each loan gets auto-debited correctly, is to bill all loans separately.  This is now going to cause a separate transaction each month on my checking account for each loan that I have.  This has been a frustrating experience with Navient to say the least.

I have contact Chase via phone and secure messaging on the their website multiple times asking them to reconsider. In my defense, my original cardholder agreement gave me 60 days of leeway to cancel without having the pay the annual fee. According to research on the internet, Chase changed their policies around XXXX XXXX and since has been refusing to waive these fees nor refund them to cardholders. I have closed all of my accounts with Chase and requested they remove me from their mail, phone, and e-mailing list.

I have contacted Chase via phone and e-mail on multiple occasions with no success. Finally, I have received no benefit/good/service from this annual fee.

2017-03-06	Mortgage	Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM)	Loan modification,collection,foreclosure		We have a mortgage with OCWEN Loan Servicing LLC . We got behind. Now its out of control. Received Pre-Forclosure Letter dated XXXX/XXXX/2017. I called spoke with XXXX ( since our assigned customer service rep was again unavailable ) We discussed the account, to do a repayment plan we needed to pay half of the arrears, plus late charges. The amount was {$3900.00}. It would require {$1900.00}. Which we did not have. I informed the csr that taxes were filed and due no later than XXXX XXXX, 2017. Without the {$1900.00} we would need to file a request for modification. At this time I was told Foreclosure had not started. I went to the web site and had issues getting to the forms. I made our payment of {$970.00} on XXXX/XXXX/2017. Then on XXXX XXXX, I called OCWEN back. I got a csr XXXX, the amount was now {$4900.00}. We discussed a 5 month repayment plan {$1000.00} down and payments of $ XXXX.Again no foreclosure in process. XXXX would put the paperwork for approval. On XXXX XXXX, I called back, and was connected with XXXX. XXXX informed the repayment plan could not be accepted since we were in active foreclosure. The amount in arrears is now {$5900.00}. In order to stop foreclosure proceedings we need to file a Modification Request. XXXX explained the process, we prefilled forms out and he would e-mail them to me. I have received the forms and its proving to be nightmare getting them out of PDF so we can fill them in/sign and return. As of today XXXX XXXX, 2017 we have not received anything in writing from OCWEN on the status of our mortgage. We did a modification 7 years ago after I lost my job. In the end, according to the paperwork we will owe a balloon payment at the end of our 30-year mortgage of {$180000.00} Which basically is where we started. I am so confused, We do not want a modification, but a repayment plan to get back on traack. We can not afford to loose this house. We do not have the funds to move 20+ years of stuff, nor time to do so, at this accelerated process.

In accordance, they are bound by FCRA to remove alleged debt from that is being reported. It is now XX/XX/2017 and past 60 days when these accounts were initially disputed. XXXX XXXX has continued to attempt to collect debt that they know is not valid and not able to be verified. Multiple disputes in regards to this issue have been filed over this, including a previous dispute with CFPB. In addition, XXXX XXXX, Equifax, XXXX and XXXX received certified letters requesting validation on this inaccurate report. They have blatantly broken the law as they relate to FDCPA and FCRA guidelines. On more than one occasion, I have tried to resolve this issue with them but they are refusing to follow the law in regards to this issue. The accounts need to be removed. They also stated that documentation was mailed to me which is false. Nothing since they placed these accounts on my reports has been mailed to me. The second issue is that it had been has been proven that the accounts are not valid, no information was provided to verify this account. They state that they are about professionalism but it is obvious that they are not. They have been deceitful, dishonest, and unprofessional in the manner that they have handled this issue from day one. I feel that the only course of action is to file a civil suit which my attorneys have drafted up and will present with my signed petition on XX/XX/2017. I am tired of dealing with this company and this issue. I will also be filing a complaint with the Attorney General as it is within my rights. They have made this process long and hard. I have also provided proof that they received the letters which was sent certified mail over 3 times to the credit reporting agencies and XXXX XXXX. Also they could not verify definitively that the accounts are mine and that they belonged on my credit. If they were sure they belonged to me, why is it so difficult for them to provide proof that this account is mine, I would like documentation with my signature, and receipts. This is what I mean by dishonest and unprofesisonal business ethics and practices. They have cost me money in this process of disputing with them and this is getting out of hand. They stated that they have a right to collect but they indeed DO NOT by rights and provisions provided to consumers under FDCPA and FCRA. This harassment and blatant disregard for the law is what is have me want to seek damages from XXXX XXXX with filing legal suit against them.		EQUIFAX, INC.

2017-03-07	Debt collection	Medical	Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed	Debt resulted from identity theft	"Commonwealth Financial Systems Inc has reported several fraudulent debt on all XXXX of my credit reports. I have disputed the fraudulent debts with all relevant credit bureaus, resulting in deletion because they cold not verify the debts through the automated dispute system. They never sent me notices for all but XXXX of them, and damaged my credit until disputed and deleted. This happened approximately XXXX times with CFSI. I know this is not really a violation ( unfortunately they will lie about notices ), but it should be. They knew they could n't verify from the time they reported. What they have done in violation of the FCRA, is sold, transferred a fraudulent debt after an identity theft block ( 605 ) was placed on a fraudulent debt they reported. I submitted block request to XXXX for the debt back in XXXX, and the debt was deleted within the specified time under FCRA. I can only assume it was blocked by XXXX, since it was deleted, and XXXX did not send me any notice regarding refusing to block, which the law would require if they did. Again, all of this means they placed a block on the CFSI debt, and should have notified CFSI that this debt was a result of identity theft. The fraudulent debt had an original creditor, current creditor, and collection agency that was to be collecting on the debt. EMP of XXXX XXXX, the original creditor, knows nothing about this debt and told me to contact the Attorney General. This was the only debt reported that I received notice from CFSI for, so I requested debt validation in the 30 day time allowed to dispute a debt. Their "" debt validation '' is a JOKE, and has Fraud written all over it. The papers they sent me looked like someone obtained my personal info from sources, and plugged in to their pathetic excuse of a debt validation. The information did not match the timeline of my true life events at the "" time of service ''. The dates, XXXX for insurance billed, and well, I 'll let you decide the ridiculous attempt at fraud for yourself. Also, these fraudsters obviously do n't have spell check, which makes them even more pathetic. The "" debt validation '' has spelling errors, refering physician, and amount refered? This accurate spelling is "" referred '' or "" referring '' you idiots, look it up. So after XXXX blocked this debt, approximately 3 weeks later, I receive a collection notice from XXXX for the SAME debt. The debt is same amount, same original creditor, same current creditor, just different collection agency this time. Really? I was a victim of identity theft, resulting in XXXX page police report, and they should not even have my personal information, they have no legal reason to, and they continue to share it, add to another database which adds more risk of it getting stolen again. They violated the law by selling, transferring, placing for collection a debt that they were told, or should 've been told was a result of identity theft. It is their responsibility to have reasonable measures in place to make sure this DOES NOT happen, and CFSI should have made sure the debt was dissolved once notified, but they knew it was fraudulent before that. If they do n't have reasonable measures to prevent this, they should be shut down. They think they are above the law, and they are in the business of collecting fraudulent debt, this just confirms that is exactly their end game. I mean, they ca n't even spell correctly on their "" debt validation '', which is beyond pathetic. The original creditor tells me to call Attorney General, so what does that say about this on top of the obvious? CFSI has also called my cell phone, which I never authorized, and never gave them my mobile phone number.

On Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notice in the mail from the Department of Treasury, stating that my Federal Tax return was being sent to XXXX due to a defaulted Federal Student Loan, which had been serviced by Navient. For just about 2 years, Navient had not tried to get into contact with me about my federal student loan, all the while having my correct address. Navient was using an incorrect address to send correspondence to me regarding my student loan, therefore the loan went into default, at no fault of my own. Navient has had all my correct information since XX/XX/XXXX, up until I moved in XX/XX/XXXX. Being that I have a private student loan through Navient, and had I been sent the information on my federal student loan, I would have been able to make payments on my federal student loan, and I would not be in this situation. Due to the lack of professionalism by Navient Corp. my loan went into default, and now {$7600.00}, which is my entire Federal tax return, has been sent to XXXX to help pay down the {$10000.00} I owe in Federal student loans. I want this money returned to me ( {$7600.00} ), and ALL my debts with Naivent Corporation settled to {$0.00}"		Navient Solutions, LLC.

2017-03-07	Student loan	Federal student loan servicing	Dealing with my lender or servicer	Received bad information about my loan	"I have been in the IBR repayment plan for probably a few years now. In XXXX of 2016, I reapplied and only received a response from Navient in XXXX, 2016 that my application was received. I did not receive any other correspondence from them until last week when I received a letter with a payment booklet stating that my payment would begin in XXXX in the amount of just under {$800.00} per month! I called to inquire about the status of my application and was told that my application was rejected because a "" box was incorrectly filled out ''. Again, I never received any notification of this. I asked if I could amend the application and was told that I would need to reapply and that my account would likely go into default in the meantime. This has happened every single time that I have sent in any application to Navient. It either is not processed, lost, or claimed to have not been received. 
Additionally, I have previously requested ( I believe from XXXX XXXX - before the account was transferred to Navient ) verification of the debt, including all signed promissory notes, and a full accounting of original debts with all fees and interest detailed. I have never received that information. I would also like to add that I have been completely mislead about these loans from day 1. I was never explained anything about the interest rates, loan terms, repayment options or anything of the like. This trend throughout the life of this alleged debt has not changed. Supposedly, my initial borrowed amount was around {$22000.00}. It has now escalated to {$65000.00}! In previous years, during financial hardships, I was never offered any other option other than request forbearances and deferments. With that, I was not relayed that interest would accrue, or the rate at which it would. I found the IBR program on my own. It was never presented or offered to me. I was never informed that any interest would accrue while in the IBR plan. I sent an inquiry to Navient a week ago asking what I need to do to reapply, but ( as usual ) have not received a response. I am so furious and confused that the original ( alleged ) amount borrowed of $ XXXX has now escalated to over $ XXXX, which includes a recent addition of {$9000.00} in interest! This makes no sense, and in my opinion, is absolute robbery! What can be done to improve the communication with Navient? What can be done to make these loans more affordable? With student loan debts surpassing credit card debt at over a trillion dollars, this is a crisis that needs better options that the ones available - and definitely a better loan servicer, with two-way communication - other than Navient."

2017-03-03	Payday loan		Charged fees or interest I didn't expect		I had a family emergency in XX/XX/XXXX and took out an {$800.00} loan from a company called Big Picture loans. I was told by a representative of the company that I would have to pay back {$1000.00} which included a {$200.00} finance charge. I thought that was kind of steep but I agreed to that term. They begin taking out {$200.00} bi-weekly out of my account. Once I reached the {$1000.00} and assuming this was my last payment, I get an email XX/XX/XXXX from them stating it 's time to process another payment out of my account in the amount of {$220.00}. I immediately called Big Picture loans but could not get anyone on the line. I conducted some research online and discovered they are predatory lenders. I took a closer look at the Disclosure statement and this is what I discovered : the interest rate of 650.0065 % and a finance charge of {$4200.00} with a total payback cost of {$5000.00}. This is ridiculous. How can they charge me {$5000.00} for an {$800.00} loan? I have paid them the {$1000.00} that I agreed to If this was explained to me during the time of taking the loan, I would have refused to take it. Please help me obtain some resolution to this issue.

On XX/XX/2017 -- I changed my password and stored it in my XXXX cloud keychain. When trying to log in later in the day, it promptly told me that my password was incorrect and locked me out of my account. This is at least the 3rd time it has happened. On top of that, when you change you password ... you 're not allowed to use any of your previous XXXX passwords. This password reset and change cycle makes it infinitely more complex to attempt to log on regularly to pay your student loans. 

In addition, they 've been allowing individuals other than myself to change account information such as contact and address information in order to collect money from family and relatives. I know this because I have seen my billing and contact information change to either my mother 's or brothers ' phones, addresses or email addresses -- this has caused considerable strain on our family relationship. This loan is not cosigned or any other way involved my relatives. 

In addition, their recurring payment option only works if your account is current ... meaning if you decide to use it while your account is overdue, it never processes a payment even if your automatic payments will meet or overpay the current balance due. With the problem of signing into your account as stated above, you can see how individuals will just end up failing to pay on time or to bring their accounts current. 

If you 'd actually like to pay your bill not online, it requires then calling them and setting up a phone payment which you are promptly charged a fee for.

I called the debt agency asking why a lawsuit was filed versus responding to my questioning the debts and was told that if they received a letter questioning the debt and did not feel the questions were specific enough, they would not respond to the letter. I guess they did not feel my questions were specific enough, because i received no response. Just notification of lawsuit. I spoke with the biller ( XXXX ) of this debt and they said they never attempted to bill my insurance for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, but somehow was able to bill for XX/XX/XXXX.

I think it was XXXX I started getting XXXX from Nelnet. 

Nelnet was giving me stuff about my Federal Student Loans at the same time as Performant Recovery. I went to US Senator Warren and said what the XXXX? 

The account number Nelnet gave me does not match the account number XXXX gave me, the amount XXXX gave me does not match the amount Nelnet gave me. XXXX to XXXX I have about XXXX social security checks garnished none of which was reported to anybody. 

My phone used to ring off the fin hook from one machine calling my house to another one calling my house. 

After talking to the US Senator Warrem my check stop getting garnished. 

XXXX might have lost his job in XXXX of XXXX shortly after that however Nelnet said we are going to garnish your check this that and the other thing. 

Nelnet refused to give me a wage garnishment hearing. They said so in a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX Nelnet did not tell me about all of my legal options such as income based repayment, heavens to beltatross imagine if they did Im {$20000.00} under the discretionary income line for my state I would be ordered to pay monthly payments of XXXX dollars but the problem comes in companies like Nelnet dont make any money that way. 

I was going through XXXX in XXXX, I did not know if I could make it to US Senator Warren office, my doctors told me to avoid large groups of people. I didnt know how I could avoid that in XXXX, so I went to US Representative Tsongus office in XXXX, In XXXX of XXXX Nelnet sent me a letter they said I had 60 days from the date on that letter to comply. I set up a doctors appointment for XX/XX/XXXX which is about 1 week before the 60 day marker. 

In XX/XX/XXXX the US Dept of Edcuation garnished my social security check, what the XXXX they were not supposed to garnish my check until XXXX according to their own letters. 

They also garnished my check for XX/XX/XXXX, but did not for XXXX of XXXX.

They have added fees and requirements that were not part of my original loan terms. Once they were notified I was going to refinance my loan I received mailings and calls in an effort to get me to refinance with Nationstar.

2017-03-07	Consumer Loan	Vehicle loan	Problems when you are unable to pay		"In XX/XX/XXXX we had a family emergency that resulted in a death in the family a few months later. In XX/XX/XXXX we missed a vehicle loan payment. From XXXX on we made full payments and were not aware of the missed XXXX payment. In the entire time we have been with PNC bank we have had little to no contact with the bank. When we lived in a state that had PNC we made monthly payments directly to the bank, and after we moved we were given a checkfree site to make payments that did not give any information about the loan. In our history that began in XXXX we have made full payments every month since the origin of the loan. On XX/XX/XXXX the vehicle was repossessed. After we talk to the bank trying to figure out what went wrong, we are informed about the XX/XX/XXXX payment and that our mailing address is not current. We changed our mailing address at that time. Upon learning of the repossession we immediately paid all the fees to make the account current. Mind you the repossession fees were more than the missing payment. It was never that we were avoiding the payment, it was that we were unaware that it had been missed. The bank informs us that letters were sent out to our old address and returned due to a bad address. Why would assume that there are issues if we have received letters from the bank in the past, at our current address, most recently XX/XX/XXXX offering other services, if there was a problem with our account. Our vehicle was repossessed over one payment from XXXX, we understand and would have gladly made things right had we known. This was n't an issue until now, and they claimed that they could n't reach us and did n't have our current address. A company was hired to locate the vehicle but no more effort was made to contact us, and the vehicle was repossessed. We were able to get the vehicle back that next day by making the missed payment, paying the associated fees to the bank and fees totaling {$520.00} to the various recovery/towing business. 
Since we have been in contact with PNC Bank trying to resolve the issue we have talked to a total of 5 different associates, seemingly having to start at the beginning with each of them. From what we are told our case has been elevated to the executive escalation department from the retail escalation department. But there is still no resolution being offered."		PNC Bank N.A.

I immediately paid the delinquent amount ( i.e. the difference between what was listed as current payment due on my billing statement versus the current payment due as listed on my account summary online ) to avoid a negative impact to my credit rating. However, this has happened now for an additional two months, so I finally called FedLoan customer service where the representative told me that this is a "" known issue '' and they have their "" IT guy working on it ''. As she explained it, apparently this is an IT issue that is causing the two "" current payment due '' amounts to not equal each other. Understanding that data issues are troublesome, I am submitting this complain because this issue has persisted for at least three months at this time and is causing other borrowers ( such as myself ) undue confusion and has the possibility to negatively impact our credit. As this is apparently a known issue that has yet to be unresolved, I would expect that FedLoan Servicing would notify borrowers of this known issue to avoid confusion ( at minimum ).

I was unaware of this fraud until recently being contacted by Portfolio Recovery Services who has purchased the debit from XXXX XXXX. 

In order to for me to investigate the fraud, and hopefully have the negative impacts removed from my credit reports, I have repeatedly asked Portfolio Recovery Services for the following information : Application records or screen prints of the original internet/phone/mail application. 
All statements/invoices ( from opening date to account closure ). 
All payment/charge slips. 
Delivery addresses associated with the account. 
Any other documents and/or investigations associated with the account. 

To date, Portfolio Recovery Services has only mailed me a few ( XXXX ) statements from the account. These statements provide scant information and do not address any of my requests stated above. Today I received a letter from Portfolio that stated the following : "" If we continue to receive subsequent correspondence from you regarding the dispute that has already been resolved, we will consider your inquiry answered. No further replies will be forthcoming. Our office considers this matter closed. '' Even though Portfolio Recovery Services knows we are disputing this account as Identity Theft, they continue to call us weekly demanding payment and we receive weekly letters from them demanding the same. They obviously are not interested in helping us investigate the fraud and are only interested in profiting from it. I hope you can help in forcing them to provide the information I so badly need.

2017-03-07	Consumer Loan	Vehicle loan	Problems when you are unable to pay		I had a vehicle loan with GM financial and after my husband lost his job my vehicle was repossessed. I was in discussion with many financial representatives for hardship status and after speaking with GMs representatives we came to an agreement amount in XX/XX/2016 that they would accept {$3800.00} as full settlement and agreed to dismiss the charge off and list it as paid in full per our conversation and agreement. This was not honored. I have worked very hard to improve my credit and have not abused lending. I have not been afforded any chances at reestablishing myself as GM/XXXX did not honor their end. If it was never the intention of the company to forgive the amount left over, they used a very dishonest way of misleading me into believing if I came up with this VERY large amount of money, that I would be free of this debt. They were able to sell the vehicle, I paid on the vehicle for a couple of years and I paid the settlement amount agreed upon. I would like this charge off, unpaid balance removed from my credit report and I would like an updated report sent to the companies who requested my information.

They will not provide proof of the Loan. They say we took out a private loan and that {$27000.00} plus was issued to my son on XX/XX/XXXX. We simply asked for a copy of the Promissory Note along with the endorsed check because we do n't feel that this money is owed. We have asked for a complete reconciliation of all debts owed so that we can look at options on our end for consolidation. Each time someone calls, its a different person, about a different account, no reconciliation forthcoming as that is always someone 's else 's department, and no proof as requested. I have written numerous letters on behalf of my son. My son and I have called Navient on many occasions in an attempt to settle this matter, and we yet have any resolve whatsoever. I need a total amount owed for everything, Private, Federal, subsidized and unsubsidized. A settlement offer, if you will, so that we can make these people go away.

I was supposed to be receive XXXX bottles of XXXX gal water per month. Instead, they were delivering XXXX bottles bi-weekly at {$6.00} per bottle. I called them and they told me they would pick the extra bottles up and adjust my account to reflect correct costs. It never happened. I called back again asking about it, was told it was n't done, but the rep I was speaking with would be putting in an order to have the unused water and empty bottle picked up at the time of the call. The driver came, but only took empty bottles not extra water. At this point I was highly upset because they were also dropping off MORE water and charging me. I had a total of XXXX bottles of water. I called after receiving a late payment notice from them and stated I was told to make payment after adjustments were made. I informed them that they needed to fix my account so I can make the payment for the correct amount I was initially told I 'd be charged, not $ XXXX+ they were now claiming I owed due to the excess water. I requested to cancel the account. They told me the account amount can not be adjusted until the water is picked up. XXXX did not deliver more water pass the XXXX bottles, but also never came to pick up the equipment & water, nor made any adjustments. 

In XX/XX/2016, I checked my credit report to see that XXXX had referred my account to CBA ( Collection Bureau of America ) and my credit ha taken a big hit, dropping XXXX points! The amount owed on my report listed by the collection agency now read {$330.00}! I never received any notice from Collection Bureau of America about the debt nor anything stating my right to dispute. I most certainly would have disputed considering the issues I was having with XXXX XXXX. After calling XXXX XXXX due to seeing the account had been transferred and the stuff still had not been picked up, they told me they could no longer do anything about the account and that I would need to talk to the collection company. XXXX XXXX purposely over charged me and ruined my credit when they decided not to pick up their product after multiple phone calls. 

I called collection company and they told me I had a {$330.00} balance and I would need to bring the equipment to the crystal warehouse and it would adjust the balance down to {$110.00}. I told them that crystal water was supposed to have picked up the products, but never did. The rep told me no one would be coming to pick the stuff up and that I would need to bring the equipment and bottles in or be charged for them. I drove over 45 minutes to drop off the stuff at XXXX 's location. The rep asked me why I was dissatisfied with the product and I explained everything that happened. He informed me that the XXXX XXXX drivers are understaffed in the area and that is why they never came to pick up the equipment and water. I am being penalized by way of being over charged and my credit ruined for a problem within the XXXX XXXX company.

2017-02-02	Mortgage	FHA mortgage	Loan servicing, payments, escrow account		Last XXXX 2016 I took on a mortgage through American Homestead in XXXX, MT. The whole process seemed seamless and very effective until after I signed all of the closing documents. Before I went to the Title company to sign a rep from American Homestead called to tell me that I would have to put down less money than was disclosed on the original closing disclosure documents. She said great news the owners gave you a buyers credit and you only have to put down x amount of dollars. I was a little surprised and confused at the same time. I asked her twice so I do n't have to put down the full 3.5 % down that the FHA loan requires and my payments will stay the same as what the closing disclosure documents stated. She said yes! I was elated thinking that I would have to put down approximately XXXX less than what was disclosed and my payments would stay at the XXXX. Long story short, 2 months after I signed the contract, XXXX the mortgage company sent me a letter saying that my escrow account was short and that I needed to come up with {$1200.00} ish or that my payments would go up {$100.00} a month for a year. I called American Homestead and spoke XXXX XXXX XXXX the head loan officer and explained to him the situation and he spoke semi aggressively and said that I was trying to take advantage of their mistake?! I was appalled with the nature of the call and decided I would just XXXX it up and make the adjusted higher payments. I have 4-5 payments left at the higher amount and it has been XXXX readjusting my calculated budget to make sure no payments are missed. On a side note my credit bureaus show perfect payment history and I intend to keep it that way even with the higher payment that was a surprise to me. Bottom line if I had been told that by making the smaller down payment than was originally agreed to and that my payments would go up {$100.00} in just a couple of months I would have stuck with the original down payment that I had ready to go from borrowing against my XXXX. The way the rep worded the sellers credit and the readjusted down payment was deceptive. The way I was talked down to by XXXX XXXX XXXX was uncalled for and I will never reconsider American Homestead or recommend them to anyone! Everything up until the down payment glitch was a great process. I was very happy with American Homestead until they made this mistake and told me that I was trying to take advantage of their mistake?! I was n't asking for extra money back, I just wanted my payment to stay the same just like the rep had told me, even after I asked twice that with the reduced down payment that my payments would stay the same! I am in sales myself and if I make a mistake I ca n't go back to the customer and tell them tough luck and by no means would I ever tell any of my customers that they are trying to take advantage of my mistake if I made XXXX. No one is perfect, I get that, but I was treated rudely and mislead. This is an example of how not to treat a consumer.

But my paperwork I got with the actual card, like I already stated everything was the same except this. Today 's APR is 19.49 %. 
I called to try to find out what happened, and I was told that since several invitations had been sent to me, that I apparently used the "" wrong invitation number '' when I applied online. 
I am certain that I did not do that. I am certain that I used the paperwork that came with the invitation that had the lower interest rate. I had thrown the other away. 
And in today 's mail, along with the actual card and the paperwork that states a different APR than the invitation did, I got yet another invitation from Discover with the rate of 13.49 % to 16.49 %! 
I was told that I could re-apply, but there was no guarantee that I would be approved this time. 
That kind of seems like a bait and switch. 
I would attach the paperwork I have to prove this, but my printer wants to do a "" cloud '' thing, and I do n't know how to do that. I would be willing to make copies, something I do know how to do, and send them to you. 
I have used the card to do a balance transfer as my car broke down and the interest on the card that I had to put it on, is pretty high. The new Discover card has a 0 % APR for the first 14 months. I hope doing this does n't affect my ability to take action against what they have done.

After speaking with XXXX, I realized that this women was from Bayview and gave her a call. She claimed I was 4 months behind on my mortgage and offered me to restructure the loan. Instead of a XXXX mortgage payment I can lower it to XXXX. My XXXX mortgage payment was in the XXXX range. I then asked her to email me some documentation and statements so I can review and respond. I still have not received any. I have called but no response. My situation is now I 'm in contract to sell the 2nd home and am afraid this will cause a problem. Not sure what to do.

2017-03-08	Credit card		Closing/Cancelling account		Three days ago, I decided to write a check to pay the balance of my Discover card for just over {$1200.00}. The payment posted today and I called to inquire why, in three years, my account has never been reviewed for a credit limit increase. The rep placed me on hold, then came back on the line and shocked me by stating my account had been revoked due to a bankruptcy. She explained she has to transfer me to another department. I assured her I have not claimed bankruptcy but she insisted. I was transferred and the new rep, a rather rude young man, asked me incredulously why I would be seeking a credit limit increase since I had filed bankruptcy. I explained to him I had not filed bankruptcy but he was convinced and told me he can not handle bankruptcies and I needed to be transferred to the bankruptcy department. He did as he insisted, despite my objections, and the line rang to a number for which the recorded message indicated they were closed and I would need to call back the following day before XXXX EST. The line then hung up. This was around XXXX PST. I tried calling Discover again but now, when I put in the last XXXX of my social, it simply gave me a number to call and disconnected on me. I called again and the same thing. I decided not to put my social in and simply get to a representative and speak to a supervisor. I reached a supervisor and explained the situation. She then started saying the previous reps misspoke indicating it was due to a bankruptcy but assured me she would call. After nearly 40 minutes on hold, she returned to the line to state I needed to call the other department and yes - they were closed. I exclaimed to her that I HAVE NOT FILED BANKRUPTCY but she could care less. I told her I would not be chasing down department after department to correct their mistake when my account shows in good faith I just paid my balance. I was not in collections and my account has always been in good standing with Discover. I told her I would be calling CFPB about this matter but, her attitude was such that she could not be bothered with my trivial issues. Here I stand now, an account paid off with my calling to wonder why they have not granted the courtesy to increase my account limit and yet I 'm told they revoked my account - on XX/XX/XXXX! Today is XX/XX/XXXX and there 's no letter or other notice. When I originally called in, there was no automated referral to an east coast number ; now there is. They offer no solutions or explanations and the rep readily admits she can not understand why the account was revoked. This will appear negative on my credit report as a revoked account and yet Discover treats me as if I am number, a warm body, occupying a phone line. Please help me to resolve this matter. Discover can not get away with doing this random act of evil to a good standing account holder and then with careless disregard, make me waste my time to chase down various departments only open during inconvenient hours to resolve the issue they obviously created and then to make matters worse, take a hit to my credit report!!

2017-02-09	Mortgage	Conventional fixed mortgage	Loan modification,collection,foreclosure		"We have owned our home since XX/XX/XXXX and secured our mortgage through Coldwell Banker/Mortgage Service Center ( CB/MSC ). We make our mortgage payment every month within the allotted time period to XXXX. Sometime over the course of our mortgage, the loan was apparently sold without our knowledge. We were never notified of any change in lenders. Over the years, we have continuously made all our payments to XXXX and were never instructed to do otherwise. In XX/XX/XXXX, we were served with "" intention to foreclose '' by an aggressive predatory mortgage lender who we had never heard of, called PHH Mortgage. During this period, PHH Mortgage refused our payments by returning our payments back to us thereby, prohibiting us from making any mortgage payments placing our loan in serious default. We requested our payments be held in escrow by our attorney. Our total sum was presented to the XXXX County court judge, where after the case was promptly dismissed for insufficient proof by PHH to show default by us, [ the homeowners ], and insufficient proof of serving us through proper legal procedure as mandated by federal law. As of XX/XX/XXXX, PHH Mortgage is attempting yet another foreclosure proceeding against us. Since our previous experience, we have kept accurate records and confirmation of all our payments. Please NOTE : All our payments continued to be paid to XXXX, the name PHH Mortgage was never used or authenticated at any time, even after the court case. Not at any time were we ever instructed to change our payment procedure. Each year, we were provided only with a coupon-style payment book with CB/MSC imprinted on the cover with a XXXX XXXX phone number inside the book to make phone payments to Mortgage Service Center. We also never received any statements at any time. Currently, we believe that over the duration of our loan, there may have been critical errors made during the time of transfer. Furthermore, PHH has harshly imposed, what we believe to be, ludicrous, erroneous, and hostile accumulative fees stating that we owe in excess of {$10000.00} in late fees ( basically the entire term of the loan ), resulting in charges being placed against our loan, severely damaging our credit, placing us in default, and a letter of "" Intention to Foreclose '' in order to justify the demand to collect on these unsubstantiated and unwarranted charges. CB/MSC/PHH has done everything in their power to ignore and delay an issue by ignoring prior written requests for our payment history, making it difficult for us to resolve an issue without legal representation, thereby incurring additional excessive costs, placing the homeowner in a vulnerable and almost impossible situation to overcome, and causing emotional and financial duress. Once again, PHH has begun returning our payments and blocking any payments made by phone. We believe their claims to be incorrect, grossly exaggerated, and unjustified thereby causing egregious accumulative and excessive charges, and we also believe CB/MSC/PHH will go to great lengths to validate, impose, and collect on these bogus charges. Furthermore, we have also questioned payments made to our homeowner 's insurance company, as they have refused to acknowledge, or purposely delayed a reply to any of our correspondence requesting information relating to our homeowner 's insurance, or our payment history. It is our belief that they have disingenuously replaced our insurance with their own, thereby forcing us to bear additional unwarranted charges. According to XXXX XXXX, CB/MSC/PHH terminated the insurance on their own. As of XX/XX/XXXX, PHH Mortgage has begun to formally identify themselves. To the best of our knowledge, our own records show that we have never missed a payment during the entire term of the loan. We have retained an attorney who will address any disparity, although we believe these claims to be disreputable."

I spoke to an individual that stated even though the language says they may charge a fee it is their practice to charge a fee. This language is extremely ambiguous as the institution can pick and choose who they want to discriminate against and charge this fee. Being a XXXX customer, I feel that I was unfairly discriminated against due to my XXXX background. Further I believe this to be a UDAAP violation as they are engaged in a deceptive practice indicating that they MAY charge a fee when they do charge it.

I successfully completed the program, however decided not to attend and instead apply to XXXX. I chose this route after learning that the facts that XXXX promoted about their graduates obtaining American XXXX were not true, and I did not want to jeopardize my future career. In order to pay for my tuition I had to take out a private loan. I applied for a XXXX XXXX XXXX loan which I was approved for, however when I informed the registrar department about my loan servicer, they encouraged me to instead take out a loan with XXXX student loans. They informed me that they had a very good relationship with this loan provider and how they disperse funds very expedient. They also told me that if my XXXX loan does not get dispersed before the end of the week, they will drop me from my classes. Out of fear of losing my spot in the program I did apply for the XXXX loan. XXXX filed for bankruptcy and I received no paperwork about my loans for years ; not until I graduated from XXXX school in XX/XX/XXXX I received correspondence. At that point my student loan had doubled in amount due to the high interest rates. However, this loan has exponentially increased compared to my other student loans. I feel like i was coerced by the registrar department at XXXX to take out this loan which is now 3x the amount. If I had gone with my original loan servicer, my balance would not be as high. I am still in XXXX and my loans are in deferment for atleast another 2 years. From investigating I have also learnt that XXXX now offers a money back guarantee for their XXXX program. I was looking for some guidance on what to do in a situation like this.		TRANSWORLD SYSTEMS INC	PA	184XX		Consent provided	Web	2017-03-08	Closed with explanation	True	No	2338977

I lost my job as a XXXX after 5 years and was waiting to be approved for unemployment and we submitted a payment for that month -- -but it was not a full payment. We did this for a few months and Carrington accepted this. Then suddenly they told us they would no longer accept partial payments. We asked if we could be considered for a modification or a restructuring of the loan or even a repayment plan. We were told no, they would not work with us, they would not assign a dedicated contact and they began the foreclosure process. We were told the only option was to reinstate the full past due balance in one lump sum and we could not do that at the time. 

I believe Carrington is in violation of state and federal guidelines relating to the servicing and handling of this loan. I was told by a counselor that they are required to review and consider myself and my husband 's financial situation for all programs available to struggling FHA loan borrowers. They have not done so, and have denied us access to programs such as modification, partial claim, forbearance or repayment plan. Despite my request for consideration for these programs or some type of review Carrington has refused to work with me. 

Due to my unexpected loss of a job we struggled to make our mortgage payment but still continued to pay what we could each month while going through this hardship. My husband is working and we have the means to afford a fair and reasonable payment. But right now we are being told there are no possible options available, and I just do n't think that is right.

The vehicle is broken, no tires, cracked Windows, check engine light on, transmission something is wrong. It has n't been started for 6years. XXXX is {$2000.00} in good condition, so why would I give them {$1200.00}? I do n't understand. They have n't contacted me since my last payment in XXXX, only the spam emails. In XXXX they continue to charge monthly {$200.00} + {$10.00} late fee until XXXX on XXXX they stopped late charges, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX they charged me anywhere from {$44.00} to {$59.00} a month for five years! I do n't know what that charge is? I do n't know what to do at this point. Ill not give them another XXXX, they wo n't give me the title. I 'm in collections for a write off! The vehicle sits! When I took the loan none of any of this was explained. It seemed like a normal loan, but the balance owing was growing faster then my payments. I have paid them over {$6000.00}. One of the big reasons I quit paying and did n't pay the registration was they told me they were going to repo the vehicle. They never came ... What can I do with the vehicle, I would like to try and fix it because I do n't have a car now. But, if they want to keep the title they need to come get their vehicle. It ca n't sit any longer! I would appreciate any advice you can offer me or help settling this horrible mistake I 've made. I 've documents if you need them. Thank You		WHEELS FINANCIAL GROUP, LLC.

2017-03-08	Bank account or service	Other bank product/service	Using a debit or ATM card		"I am a resident of XXXX and have been banking with Santander since XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX significant amounts of money were fraudulently withdrawn from my Santander checking and money market accounts. A substantial cash withdrawal from my money market account was made at a Santander branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ; shortly thereafter another substantial cash withdrawal from my checking account was made at a Santander branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
Four days later, when I was checking my balances online, I noticed the withdrawal activity and immediately notified Santander. I spoke to a representative ( XXXX ), who informed me to contact the Fraud Department. On XX/XX/XXXX I called the Santander Fraud Department, spoke to a XXXX XXXX, and filed a claim. XXXX XXXX informed me my accounts were initially 'flagged and frozen ', to sign an affidavit at a local branch, and file a police report with my Township Police Department -- all of which I completed that day. 
After filing my claim, the total amounts fraudulently withdrawn from my Santander accounts were returned and I received a 'Fraud Claim Receipt ' letter from Santander indicating that my case had been assigned to a case manager, XXXX XXXX XXXX and that I will 'be notified in writing of the results of [ the ] investigation of my claim '. This same letter specified that I was assigned a Fraud Investigator, XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX called and informed me that the perpetrator used only fake identification and a credit card to withdraw the funds from my account. He also said I was misinformed by XXXX XXXX and that indeed my accounts were never 'flagged and frozen ' and that this incident did not warrant those actions. XXXX XXXX further said that he will not 'notify me in writing of the results of [ the ] investigation of my claim ' as indicated in the letter I received from Santander . 
I was understandably vexed as to how and why this type of fraudulent activity could transpire, why my accounts were not immediately placed on hold, why I was not informed of these activities, why I would not receive the investigation document promised by Santander, and why I was grossly misinformed of important details by my case manager, XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX defended the policies of Santander by stating that it is a 'customer service business and anyone with identification ( driver 's license ) can get access to any account ' -- effectively, access to funds supersedes bank protection of funds. XXXX XXXX informed me that since I received my money back, my case is settled and I should have no other concerns. 
XXXX XXXX then posed the question : 'just because you decide to withdraw a lot of money -- does that make it wrong '? The answer to that is : exclusively, no. However, given the weight of evidence in relation to my regular banking practices ( since opening accounts ) there are some clear and obvious inconsistencies : 1 ) Out-of-state branch transactions ( XXXX in XXXX since opening accounts ), 2 ) High dollar amounts ( XXXX cash withdrawals over XXXX since opening accounts ), 3 ) Missing bank card ( XXXX attempts to withdrawal cash without card since opening accounts ), 4 ) Back-to-back high-value cash withdrawals in different branches within same city ( XXXX consecutive cash withdrawals over XXXX since opening accounts ), XXXX ) Recent account conversion ( 1 day prior converted savings to MM ). 
This letter serves as a testimony to the susceptibility of the Santander security architecture and the inferior communicative efforts in the aftermath of that security failure. My confidence and respect in banking with Santander has been entirely diminished ; my hope is that my unfortunate experience with Santander might serve as a warning to others in the banking security sector."

2017-03-08	Mortgage	Conventional fixed mortgage	Loan servicing, payments, escrow account		"This is a follow up complaint regarding DovenMuehle Mortgage. The original issue has not been resolved. 
My issue with Dovenmuehle Mortgage Company ( DMC ) began in XX/XX/XXXX ; they still have {$10000.00} as of today, XX/XX/XXXX. 
Short background : I am the trustee for my best friend 's estate. When she died I sent documents to DMC asking to transfer the mortgage into the trust. I received a letter in XX/XX/XXXX stating "" We are pleased to inform you that the issue in your correspondence has been addressed ''. 
As trustee I had to manage the financial and logistical issues surrounding damage to the home she owned. That home holds a mortgage with DMC. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received XXXX checks totaling {$15000.00} from the homeowners insurance for repairs to the mortgaged property from a flood. Since the checks listed DMC and my name ( as trustee of the Trust ) as co-payees, I submitted that check to DMC with a letter asking them cosign and return to me. Heard nothing for over a month. I called and they said that the checks would be forthcoming. Two weeks later on XX/XX/XXXX, they sent me the same checks that I had sent them, asking for me to cosign and return them to them ; which I did on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, they cashed the checks and put the money in escrow and released {$5200.00}, in a check made payable to the estate. Since there was no estate, just the Trust - of which I am the trustee, I had difficulty depositing that check. The bank relented but said that they would not make that exception again. That check came with a lien waiver but no explanation. I called and asked them why they kept the money ( and made the check payable to the wrong payee ). They said that they needed the contactor to sign a lien waver to release the funds. Since the work was not done and the contractor not paid, I had to find funds from other sources to complete the work, pay the contractor so that he would sign the lien waver. 

I submitted that lien waver to DMC on XX/XX/XXXX with a letter indicating that the work was complete and DMC should issue the remaining funds. Due to the lack of communication, the length of time, the terrible customer service and the withholding of funds due to me, I filed the above listed complaint ( Case number : XXXX ) with the CFPB. DMC responded to that complaint with a lengthy letter enumerating what they had done to resolve this situation. More than 90 % of the items they listed, they had not performed and the 2 checks for the remaining funds were issued. 

Two checks arrive on XX/XX/XXXX. One in the amount of {$10000.00} and one for {$35.00} presumably for interest, though there was no accompanying documentation. Problem solved? 

No ... the checks were both made payable to the Estate. The bank, not surprisingly would n't cash the checks, saying that I could only do so if I opened a separate account, in the name of the estate - but I could only do that if the estate was probated, which is one of the reasons trusts are in place. 

There is no estate ; there never was. There is a trust. I hired an estate lawyer ; I was advised that an Affidavit of Small Estate should be sent to DMC. I complied and sent that with other documentation and the unredeemed checks back to be reissued on XX/XX/XXXX. Weeks go by and once again the XXXX hole that is DMC did not respond On XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX ( XXXX ) in DMC-Loss Draft and left a message. Three days later she returned my call and said that there was nothing DMC could do. Her supervisor ( XXXX ) said the same thing. According to them, I had reached the end of XXXX road - no resolution. I asked what I could to do resolve this problem and they simply repeated that they could n't help me. 

I asked for the name of someone in a legal division or estates. My call was directed to a customer service line, which ke"		Dovenmuehle Mortgage, Inc.	CA	939XX		Consent provided	Web	2017-03-08	Closed with explanation	True	No	2377045

Regardless, it is illegal to charge someone for an item that can not be delivered under the transactions terms and American Express is not acknowledging that. I spoke to Amex representative in XX/XX/XXXX who agreed to have his supervisor override the system to initiate a dispute. But when I checked back, no dispute was ever initiated.

2017-03-08	Mortgage	Conventional fixed mortgage	Loan modification,collection,foreclosure		"After a lengthy process to obtain a loan modification and completing trial payments by XX/XX/2017, I received correspondence from Ocwen saying I was delinquent and foreclosure was being initiated. I contacted Ocwen and through conversation determined that my loan modification was cancelled because I did not return the original signed document. It turned out that Ocwen had mailed my loan modification to an old address and not to the property where I reside. That package was sent in a way that did not trigger non-receipt or return the abandoned envelope which laid on the doorstep of a vacant home several states away for two months. 
Agreement was gained to have Ocwen reship the document to the property for my signature. I received, signed and returned the packaged within two business days. I continued to make my monthly payment however they began getting returned to my account and no accepted. 
I contacted Ocwen and learned that the booking of my signed document had to be tasked as an exception and that was not done my the last service representative. After much back and forth I requested my issue be escalated and was advised that Ocwen does not have an escalation process and the service representative was it. We agreed that they would enter the task for my modification to be booked and I would follow up in two weeks. 
Payments still not being accepted, I called for my follow up and learned that I would need to follow up in three more weeks. I suddenly received the permanent modification countersigned by Ocwen in my mail. Thrilled, I followed up again and asked if I could tender all of the payments that had been returned and the past due amount was higher due to default fees. 
I argued that I was never in default and that based on the circumstances notated in their servicing system the default fees should be reversed. The service representative agreed and entered a task for that to occur. 
Again, my monthly payment was returned and again I received correspondence suggesting I was in foreclosure. I contacted Ocwen and it turned out my permanent modification, though counter signed and returned to me, had never been booked. 
Feeling frustrated and helpless after 9 months of back and forth, I contacted the law firm listed on the foreclosure notices and was escalated to XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I shared the background as cited above and provided her accounting of my bank account with a building balance for all of the returned payments along with a copy of the fully countersigned permanent modification. My follow up with XXXX XXXX continued for several months with no outcome, only responses that she has escalated and is waiting to hear back. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, I sent all of the returned payments in one check to Ocwen and notified the law firm that I was doing so. Ocwen returned the funds again. 
XXXX XXXX, 2017 I received a notice of foreclosure again with a XX/XX/XXXX sale date. Mind you I have made payment each month that are all being returned and accumulating in my accounts still. I contacted XXXX XXXX asking for payment instructions so I could send the funds directly to the law firm. She responded with one line advising that XXXX XXXX would now be my contact. I reached out to XXXX XXXX requesting payment instructions and continue to wait even after several follow up attempts. 

I have all payments. 
I have the ability to pay. 
I have a family in a family home. 
Ocwen and their vendors are disorganized and disrespectful and have caused a great deal of pain and anguish that is unnecessary. Please help me to get this foreclosure date cancelled, my monies accepted and applied and full resolution brought to this matter so I can return to being a normal paying customer."

I was under the impression that it was XXXX months after you GRADUATE, not during your summer breaks. I took classes during XXXX summer semesters, but not during every summer. By the time I was notified that my payment was overdue, I had thousands of dollars in interest that had accumulated the entire time I was in school.

My loans are all broken up with letters of the alphabet, 2 As, 2 Bs, then letters C-G. I 've paid off C, but it cost me {$900.00} for a {$200.00} initial loan.

I was getting a mortgage when I found out that my XXXX month grace period was over years ago, I called Nelnet, they had me mixed up with a different person.

I called back, and they could n't tell me how much I owe, or how long the payments would go on for. 
Right now I 'm trying to pay them off as fast as I can, and I send extra every month. XXXX of my loan groups I do n't technically owe a payment on until XXXX of 2018. I pay every group.

2017-03-08	Mortgage	Conventional fixed mortgage	Loan servicing, payments, escrow account		At the end of XXXX, I noticed on the NationStar website that my mortgage payment was to increase by {$1200.00} for the XXXX payment. My mortgage payment was going from {$2200.00} to {$3500.00} from XXXX to XXXX. When I looked at the escrow I noticed that they charge me twice the PMI amount for a couple of months. I also noticed that they estimated that the county and city taxes will be paid twice a year instead of once a year. When I called them to bring it to their attention, they also let me know that they had the wrong parcel number for my home. Next, I demanded that they re-submit an escrow analysis because the increase was ridiculous. They are refusing to do so until they get updated information ( which I do n't see them lifting a finger to get ). I 've been fighting to get them to update my escrow analysis for 2 weeks now and every time I call them I have to start over. Now I 'm having to run around and collect all the necessary documents because they are just going to stick with what they have even though the numbers do n't make any sense.

This of course would be easy to provide by writing a few lines of code. But no. Instead, they will only alert the account holder until AFTER they can charge a late fee. No other financial services company I use does not offer a pre-penalty alert feature. No one. Chase should be ashamed of this obvious tactic to fleece its customers of fees.		JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

Despite my pleas for help they have not opened up a review of my financial information nor assigned a single point of contact. Instead they have scheduled a sale date of my home for XX/XX/XXXX. Nationstar is the XXXX different bank to hold my loan. I have been trying for a long time to fix this problem of my delinquent payments but every time I seem to be getting some traction the loan gets transferred. I am employed and have owned my house for 11 years and want to save it. This is a conventional loan that I believe is backed by XXXX. I just heard that there were some new programs to help homeowners with conventional XXXX loans and I think I could qualify. My interest rate is 7 % and I have suffered a real hardship the last few years. 

I have worked in construction for over 30 years and had steady employment and money in the bank when I bought my home. Like millions of Americans, I was blindsided by the recession and found myself in and out of work for the next couple of years. I was still making my mortgage payment each month, but the writing was on the wall that it would be difficult to maintain. I reached out to my servicer at the time to apply for help. ( I believe it was XXXX XXXX or XXXX at that time ). They told me that even though I had an obvious financial crisis going on, they would not consider my application unless I was behind on my mortgage loan. So I took their advice and stopped making my payment in order to be considered for mortgage assistance. I started the modification process but within a matter of a few months I was being threatened with foreclosure by the agents at the bank. So I had to scramble and borrow money and do whatever I could to get caught up on the loan. But the problem had not been solved, I was still barely staying afloat. 

I hung on as long as I could but eventually due to the high payment vs. my income and sporadic unemployment I fell behind. I tried to work with all of the companies who held the loan -- XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and every time that it seemed I was making progress the loan would get transferred. I have never been assigned a designated point of contact by Nationstar and have never had a review completed. I deserve to be considered for these new XXXX backed programs, as well as all other government and in house programs that Nationstar has available."

2017-03-03	Bank account or service	(CD) Certificate of deposit	Account opening, closing, or management		In XXXX XXXX, I was asked by a Citizens Bank Investment Counselor XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to take my IRA Account of {$93000.00} and invest my retirement funds with Citizen Investment Services and was orally quoted that my retirement account would yield ( at least ) 8 % OR greater but no less than 8 percent annually. The income would then be posted on the XXXX anniversary date of the investment. I became worried and very upset upon getting monthly statements from this new investment put forth by XXXX XXXX XXXX. In fact, my $ XXXX investment within months showed a decrease in excess of {$4000.00}. I became so upset when receiving statement after statement with a huge loss of my retirement funds, I made several phone calls and e-mails to XXXX XXXX who explained that when ( in XXXX XXXX ) the posting of my first anniversary dividend ... that I would see a huge dividend and increase to my investment. I really thought XXXX XXXX was being honest with me, however, I soon learned that he lied to me about the return on my investment and too, that an investment friend whom I later became associated with told me about FINRA, an organization that keeps track of investment brokers, etc. Much to my surprise, XXXX XXXX had a complaint lodged against him for which he was found responsible for and too made to make restitution of {$9100.00}. I did file a complaint with XXXX XXXX 's parent company located in Massachusetts, however, they too, replied to me with bold face lies as to the scenario of events and too, what XXXX XXXX told me. In fact, to prove my point, XXXX XXXX, probably through a mistake copied my entire file he had on me, sent to to an investment broker and included a brochure which stated that the investment could yield better than 8 % or better. This proved that I did not just make up the percentage return on my IRA investment nor that I fabricated anything. I just received my XXXX XXXX Statement and AFTER SIX YEARS, my principal balance increased ONLY {$10.00}. Citizens Investment Services USED my {$93000.00} and probably earned 30 % or better. This is morally, ethically and criminal. Lastly, I did find out that the Security and Exchange Commission has repeatedly fined the Citizens Group of wrongful acts among its many spin-off subsidiaries. I NEED YOUR HELP to get my investment back together with the dividend income promised me, since inception. I am enclosing several documents and can give you the name of someone who has additional information in this matter.		CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.

2017-03-08	Student loan	Federal student loan servicing	Dealing with my lender or servicer	Received bad information about my loan	"I attended XXXX, a computer training school. I made an agreement with XXXX ( XXXX ), A third-party collection agency working on behalf of Navient, that they were authorized to accept {$2000.00} as payment in full for my student loan. It was further agreed to remove all derogatory information from my credit reports upon receiving this payment. As agreed, all negative school loan information was removed from my credit reports only to be replaced on my credit report again year later. 

This was originally a joint account with my mother and myself who cosigned the loan. There were additional "" unverifiable '' comments made by Navient that the agreement was only to remove the co-borrower from the loan. Conveniently, XXXX has no record of having serviced my account, which leaves me only to deal with the refuted agreement as Navient has chosen to interpret it. They finally agreed to modify my account only to leave it in a damaged state. The original agreement was to completely and permanently remove the student loan account or delete all derogatory information. The recording of the conversation and agreement is also conveniently unavailable by XXXX or by Navient. 

After a year worth of disputes since the agreement was made ( XXXX ). The student loan still remains as a derogatory account on my credit file with the statement added "" settled in full, for less than the full amount ''. As a last effort create a winning agreement, I sent Navient a certified letter outlining very specific terms for a modification of the information currently being reported in exchange for additional funds in the amount of {$500.00}. I followed up a week later with a second letter restating the details of the first letter with the check enclosed as previously foretold. The body of the agreement as outlined in the second certified letter that I sent is as follows : "" I have a closed collection with Navient that has been paid in full, but for less than the full amount. 

Upon my speaking with a representative of your company, I have learned that the entire debt that was in collection was in the amount of {$5600.00}, which includes all taxes and fees. The amount that was paid to settle this debt in full was {$2000.00}. As I 'm sure that you are aware, simply making a payment towards a settled account will not have an impact on my FICO score, which is my primary concern. 

With this in mind, I would like to make the following proposal, which if you choose to accept is a "" non-negotiable '' agreement between Navient and me. 

I have enclosed a personal check by U.S. Postal mail via certified delivery in the amount of {$500.00} as full payment of the full amount that was previously forgiven. This check includes a "" restrictive endorsement '' on the back, which reads as follows : "" By cashing this check Payee agrees to accept this check in full payment of the account as agreed and agrees to remove all derogatory information from Remitter 's Credit Report '' Cashing or depositing the enclosed check is your acknowledgement of the terms and conditions agreed to in this letter and it is also agreed that the corresponding adjustments to my credit report shall occur within 30 days of cashing or depositing the aforementioned check. I hope that you will accept my proposal, as it is a win-win scenario for all parties involved. Thank you for your consideration. '' In addition to possessing the receipts for delivery of both certified letters, I received a letter from Navient acknowledging receipt of my correspondence. The letter and the check had very specific terms of agreement which are supported by NC Accord and Satisfaction Law. However, Navient has on after thought chosen to mail me a check to refund the {$500.00} which remains uncashed as it does not resolve the breached agreement that they entered into upon cashing the enclosed check."

2017-03-04	Payday loan		Charged fees or interest I didn't expect		Over the course of the summer, I applied for an installment loan with Avant at a 12 % interest rate. I selected a loan amount of {$11000.00} in which I thought it would be a 12 % interest rate for 36 months. On the website, the interest rate was and is hidden. Also, it is hard to tell how much you owe as well. Upon performing further research, I have learned that I am paying a 4 year loan at 34 %. I called Avant and complained about my rate and was advised I can apply again within 6 months. I waited 6 months and they said that you will actually have to wait 12 months to refinance. I have paid XXXX payments with a total amount of {$3400.00} with only paying down {$830.00} of the principal. I have a XXXX credit score and had recently applied for a pre-approval for a home mortgage, but I was denied the amount requested due to this high paying loan as it was a concern for my lender. I have performed research and have found out that this is predatory lending and I would like present my case and my loan application to be reviewed. I never applied for a 34 % Loan as this type of loan will keep individuals in eternal debt.		Avant Credit Corporation	OH	432XX		Consent provided	Web	2017-03-08	Closed with explanation	True	No	2371931

2017-03-08	Student loan	Federal student loan servicing	Dealing with my lender or servicer	Having problems with customer service	"From XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, I applied and received XXXX Parent PLUS loans to help with my XXXX children 's college tuition and expenses. In XX/XX/XXXX I consolidated several loans and ended up with XXXX separate loans. In XX/XX/XXXX, I had decided to refinance all loans, since I was finished needing money for my children 's college. My bank, XXXX, wanted me to get preliminary numbers, so on XX/XX/XXXX, I called FedLoan Services to get payoff amounts for the remaining XXXX accounts. After all paper work was gathered, I was approved for the loan and on XX/XX/XXXX, I had a 3 way call with FedLoan, XX/XX/XXXX, and myself. XXXX was a third party hired by XXXX to collect and verify the final amounts due on each loan so those amounts could be included in the loan documents for closing set for XX/XX/XXXX. My only responsibility on the XX/XX/XXXX phone call was to give FedLoan permission to give the final XXXX payoff amounts to XXXX XXXX. Our loan closed on XX/XX/XXXX, on schedule. My phone records show I made 2 calls to FedLoan on the afternoon of XX/XX/XXXX. Although the purpose of those calls was to verify the correct wire transfer information so the title company could pay the loans in full as quickly as possible, FedLoan insists that those calls were made in order to get a lump sum payoff amount. Since the loan had already funded at XXXX that morning, a payoff amount was not necessary. The bank was paying the loan, not us and the bank verified the amounts due previous to closing. I am attaching a copy of the XXXX XXXX XXXX given to the bank showing each loan and the payoff amount. The monies to pay the XXXX loans in full was wired on XX/XX/XXXX. A few days later I checked online to make sure my loans had been paid off and was surprised to find they had not. I made several phone calls inquiring as to why the loans still showed a balance and no one could tell me why. On two different occasions the representative I spoke with told me I had accrued {$14000.00} in interest in two weeks which is ludacris! No one could explain where the balance came from. I continued to contact FedLoan Services and ask for supervisors. I spoke with a couple of them who would then call me back and leave messages with no way to contact them. I was finally able to file a formal case for review. That case has now been reviewed by the same person named "" XXXX '' twice. He has offered absolutely no explanation as to where the additional amount due came from and why it was n't given to the bank. Although he has provided by email a chart with all XXXX of my loans and info, it does n't match any of the information they provided XXXX XXXX so it is impossible to see where the problem is. I have asked for recordings of phone calls or transcripts at the very least. I have repeatedly asked for an accounting to be given so that I can understand what has happened here and he has provided me with NOTHING. I have even asked that they at least stop charging me interest until this situation is resolved and the interest continues to accrue daily. I have asked that my case be reviewed a third time in hopes that they will provide some explanation as to why I still have principal and interest due on these loans."

2017-03-08	Student loan	Federal student loan servicing	Dealing with my lender or servicer	Received bad information about my loan	"This is a complaint against the Great Lakes Company. Better Business Bureau had specifically recommended reaching out to you with these concerns. 

Through my correspondences with this organization, I have been verbally lied to and assured on three occasions that proved to be false, and been told false written statements by this company by a Senior Executive, which was provided to the Better Business Organization. It was only after I had to involve In House Counsel at Great Lakes that they subsequently changed their story regarding how they had misrepresented my claim to the Better Business Bureau. 

The Background : There are multiple instances of the Organization putting unreasonable barriers toward a consumer being able to pay their loans. Notably, the Organization has a policy wherein they do not provide the contact information of customer representatives, and consumers are told that representatives do "" not have access to e-mail. '' This is not the industry standard. Other student provides allow for electronic communications. And, as I detail below, as this company makes false statements and false verbal assurances, this is a company that should absolutely be required to have electronic communication as an option for student consumers. 

The Specifics : On XX/XX/XXXX, Great Lakes e-mailed me that my income-driven repayment was received. A month later, I reached out in XX/XX/XXXX for a status update, and was told that my payment schedule would be "" generated over the weekend '' and be provided the next Monday or Tuesday. I was assured I would be able to pay my first bill in XX/XX/XXXX. The following week, I called again to check on the status of my application and when the payment schedule would arrive. I was again told that it would be "" generated over the weekend '' and received by "" early next week. '' The payment schedule never arrived. I again called the next week for an update on my application, and was told by the first customer representative that the payment schedule would be generated "" over the weekend. '' As this had been the third time over a period of three weeks that I was told this statement only to then never receive the document the subsequent week, I asked to speak with her supervisor, XXXX ( XXXX ). XXXX informed me that he needed to do "" research on my account '' because he had "" no idea '' why they were telling me that the payment schedules would be generated. In his opinion, all of the representatives would need to get "" talked to. '' I 'm not sure why three representatives would have responded with the same misstatements, but there are significant concerns with the training of representatives if they are telling consumers something that is not reflected whatsoever on the account. In a review of my e-mails, I am in receipt of the same exact e-mail from Great Lakes on three occasions regarding the company receiving my application for income-based repayment. On XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, I received the same e-mail from Great Lakes, stating "" We received your income-driven repayment application. '' I 'm not sure what is causing this extreme disorganization, but clearly the Office was in receipt of these documents by XX/XX/XXXX, and for whatever reason, it has provided me the same e-mail over the next two months. 

Their False Statements Provided to Better Business Bureau : Consumers - especially vulnerable consumers such as students - are generally unsophisticated when it comes to reporting the conduct of Great Lakes. What makes this story so concerning is how Great Lakes responded when I submitted the complaint to the Better Business Bureau. The initial responses from Better Business yielded no positive resolution, so the Director of Customer Support, XXXX, became involved when it was escalated and when I had written to the President of the Company.

I have not received a bill or a phone call from Chase. This credit card does not exist in my online Chase account. If it were n't for the credit-monitoring service, I would n't even know about this "" unpaid bill ''. 
I spoke with a supervisor in the dispute department who said I could reopen the dispute. He could n't help me with clearing up the hit to my credit rating or remove the interest charges."		JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.	IL	606XX		Consent provided	Web	2017-03-08	Closed with explanation	True	No	2378558

2017-03-02	Mortgage	Conventional fixed mortgage	Settlement process and costs		On XX/XX/2016 I started the ReFi of my mortgage with AnnieMAC, we did not close until XX/XX/2017. In the beginning I was working with a Loan Originator which seem like everything was fine, I responded to her questions and needs and did the same for me. A week before the election, my appraisal came back and all the other paperwork required, I emailed her make sure that we were locked in at 3.8 % with no points. The day before the election I tried to get a hold of her to make sure because with election, interest rates could go either way. I was unable to get anybody at the company, their phone tree prevented me from getting a live person. I finally got a number through the web page and talked to a receptionist, she help me get in touch with a manager, his name is XXXX, he told me that the loan originator that I was working with was no longer with the company, nobody from the company had picked-up her clients, and according to him she never locked me in at 3.8 %, by now rates had gone up to 4.125 % with 1 point. They assigned a new loan originator, his name is XXXX and I had to start all over again. I told him not to lock me in and that we would just watch the market and after doing all the paperwork again, underwriting kept coming up with more items for me to get, instead of making a list and sending it to me, they would ask for something, wait a few days and ask for something else and wait a few more days and ask for more and more. They seemed like they did not know what they were doing. Finally in XXXX tells me that everything is good and we can close last week of XXXX. I locked in on XX/XX/XXXX at what I thought was 4.125 % with a small out of pocket for me. Turned out he locked me in at 4 % with a little more than XXXX points. At this point I just wanted to get it done, I asked him if we could wait until the first week of XXXX to sign so I could skip the XXXX payment, he said fine. Then after the 1st of the year it started again, a whole of more inquires from underwriting, all the way through to XX/XX/XXXX. The whole process felt like these guys are a bunch of rookies. With what started out as a not cost to me ReFi ended costing me {$18000.00}. I have all the emails going back and forth if you need them.

2017-03-02	Bank account or service	Other bank product/service	Deposits and withdrawals		"PayPal Attention : Legal Department XXXX XXXX, California XXXX To Whom May Concern : I am writing this letter about my experiences with PayPal. 

I am the victim of identity theft. My brother stole MY identity, as well as that of my mother and my father and used our information to commit fraud. 
In XXXX, he hacked into my computer as well as our cable TV system while I was at work, and my parents were at work, and ordered pornographic materials. In addition, he opened several credit accounts in my parents name ( even after my Dad passed away in XXXX ). 
Most recently, he successfully opened a credit card in my name, which, fortunately, I was able to intercept before he was able to use it. 
Over the years, we filed the appropriate police reports, and I also opened an identity theft report with the federal government as well. 
In XXXX, my brother moved out and "" ran '' from his creditors and is currently living out of state. There is an open, active, and on-going investigation by the Connecticut State Police. 
He has been advised that he is to have NO FURTHER CONTACT with us, including using our name, address, or telephone number for his personal business! 

Going back a little bit, PayPal blocked my HOTMAIL account for violating their terms of use policy. 
To date, I have NOT received ANY documentation of this violation. 

Around XXXX, I opened a new PayPal account, using my GMAIL address. 
I used this account for XXXX YEARS, primarily for XXXX and some recurring payments on-line. 
During this time, I had NO PROBLEMS. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, PayPal all of a sudden, blocked my GMAIL account for UNKNOWN reasons, citing only my previous issue connected to my HOTMAIL account 11 years ago. 
I contacted PayPal SEVERAL times, explaining the situation, and all I get are "" appeal denied '' emails. 
I have even forwarded PayPal letter from the FTC verifying y identity theft case AND the case #, officer name, and other information from the CSP regarding my identity theft issue, and, once again, received only "" appeal denied '' emails. 

At this point, I have begun to look into taking legal action against PayPal. 
I have contacted the Federal Trade Commission to file a complaint, however, they require additional information. I have also contacted an attorney, and he advised me to get additional information before I hire him to pursue a case against PayPal. Both the attorney and FTC have advised me that PayPal is considered a financial institution, and is governed by federal and state law ( s ). 
XXXX of my rights, under the law, is a right to a copy of ALL information related to a financial transaction conducted, using MY name and/or banking information. 
I have requested this information by e-mail, and my request was denied. 
I also spoke with PayPal customer service several times, and they were also UNABLE to provide me the information I requested. During the most recent phone conversation, the representative advised my that I had to put my request in writing, to the legal department at PayPal ; and that is what I am doing. 

I am hereby OFFICIALLY requesting ANY and ALL information, as well as a detailed explanation of the transactions on my ORIGINAL HOTMAIL PayPal account that violated the acceptable use policies of PayPal. 

I am also requesting a review of my GMAIL PayPal account and a detailed explanation as to why this account has been blocked, as it has NOTHING to do with, and is NOT connected to my HOTMAIL account. 

Please send all information and documentation to : XXXX XXXX XXXX, Connecticut XXXX I am hopeful that we can resolve this matter out of court, as all I am requesting is a review of my GMAIL account, and the full restoration of my GMAIL account privileges. 
I have provided PayPal with all the appropriate documentation regarding my identity theft issues.

They state they are not a collection agency and are a legal aid firm for XXXX. They claim I owe them {$16000.00} and need to settle or they will sue me. I have asked for a validation of debt notice as I have never received any correspondence from them. They state I need to call XXXX and refuse to mail me any documents. They will not give me their address to mail a cease and desist letter. I am unable to stop the phone calls and they are harassing me and my family. They claim to be based in XXXX, NY. They have violated a countless amount of FDCPA related laws, but I am unable to continue the process without them giving me any information.
